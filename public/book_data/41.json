[{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/rip-van-winkle/quotes-by-character/","quotes":[{"quote":"I have observed that he was a simple, good-natured man; he was moreover, a kind neighbor, and an obedient, hen-pecked husband.","desc":"Early in the story, the narrator describes Rip in such a way that he seems to be a very nice man; he simply doesn't want to do any work or fulfill any of the responsibilities that come with being a husband, father, or farmer. He is not, as is demonstrated in the narrative, obedient. His wife, it is implied, is wholly unreasonable for expecting anything of him."},{"quote":"In a word, Rip was ready to attend to anybody's business but his own; but as to doing family duty, and keeping his farm in order, he found it impossible.","desc":"At the beginning of the story, it is clear the narrator is determined to describe Rip in the best possible light. Over and over, Rip is portrayed as well-meaning and decent, his shortcomings dismissed as irrelevant. The narrator presents Rip as simply not cut out to be an adult, and repeatedly expresses frustration that Rip's wife is annoyed with him."},{"quote":"Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart temper never mellows with age, and a tart tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use.","desc":"Dame Van Winkle, who isn’t given a first name in the story, is Rip’s antagonist. According to the narrator, she does not give Rip a single moment of rest from her constant barrage of insults, demands, and expectations. However, it appears that she is taking care of her household entirely on her own, with absolutely no input from Rip. She is the one making sure the family is fed, housed, and clothed as Rip wanders and avoids taking on his role as a father and husband."},{"quote":"'Oh she too, had died but a short time since; she broke a blood-vessel in a fit of passion at a New-England [man].'","desc":"From the narrator’s perspective, there seems to be nothing more aggravating and off-putting than a woman who expects her husband to take responsibility. This dismissiveness extends even to her death, about which Rip is told by his adult daughter, resulting in his feeling relieved. Adding insult to injury, his daughter indicates that Dame Van Winkle died because she was so upset at someone her brain exploded. In a story as gentle and strange as this one, Dame Van Winkle is, whether justly or not, the closest thing the narrative has to a villain."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/rip-van-winkle/quotes-by-theme","quotes":[{"quote":"Its chief merit is its scrupulous accuracy, which indeed was a little questioned on its first appearance, but has since been completely established; and it is now admitted into all historical collections as a book of unquestionable authority.","desc":"In the introduction, the author insists on the truth of the story that follows. By explaining how the story is told by Diedrich Knickerbocker, a (fake) historian of the Dutch colonies, the story claims to be true, while simultaneously admitting to its fiction. This split sets up the instability of truth that Irving highlights throughout the story."},{"quote":"Indeed, I have heard many stranger stories than this, in the villages along the Hudson; all of which were too well authenticated to admit of a doubt.","desc":"In the note following the story, the narrator admits that the story is very similar to a German folktale. However, rather than humbly concede the folktale's influence on the story, the narrator provides a note from the fictional storyteller insisting this proves the story is true. Knickerbocker argues that Rip Van Winkle’s tale is not even the strangest story he has heard, and since the other, odder stories have been true, this story must be true also. Irving refuses to let the story simply be a story, further complicating the relationship readers have with the text."},{"quote":"Poor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair; and his only alternative, to escape from the labor of the farm and the clamor of his wife, was to take gun in hand and stroll away into the woods.","desc":"As Rip begins his fateful journey into the woods, the narrator suggests that the only way for him to escape his duties as a husband and father is going into the woods, despite having already mentioned various other methods Rip uses to avoid working at home. This suggests that the problem is less that Rip is overwhelmed by despair over what his wife asks of him and more that he has no interest and no motivation to do anything. Rip's laziness is forgiven by the narrator without reserve, whereas his wife, who is presumably the only adult working in and around the house, is portrayed as comically unreasonable."},{"quote":"Having nothing to do at home and being arrived at that happy age when a man can be idle with impunity, he took his place once more on the bench at the inn-door, and was reverenced as one of the patriarchs of the village, and a chronicle of the old times 'before the war.'","desc":"When Rip returns to his village after a twenty-year absence, he is elevated to a place of honor as a town elder. As someone who never wanted responsibility in his youth, he is now allowed to live in idleness as an elder. Rip gets what he has always wanted without any of the work or sacrifices insisted upon by his society."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/rip-van-winkle/quotes-about-the-setting","quotes":[{"quote":"They are a dismembered branch of the great Appalachian family, and are seen away to the west of the river, swelling up to a noble height, and lording it over the surrounding country.","desc":"At the beginning of the story, the Kaatskill (Catskill) Mountains are introduced as the setting. The prose describing them is grandiose and mythic, providing the story with a setting as impressive and unlikely as its plot. The mountains are mysterious, mercurial, and unknowable, much like the events they will host throughout the story."},{"quote":"He saw at a distance the lordly Hudson, far, far below him, moving on its silent but majestic course, with the reflection of a purple cloud, or the sail of a lagging bark, here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom, and at last losing itself in the blue highlands.","desc":"The Hudson River, as viewed by Rip during his infamous trip into the woods, is an important part of the landscape of the region. The man for whom it is named is also an important figure in the story. It is Hendrick (Henry) Hudson whose party of abandoned spirits Rip encounters in the forest. The ancient explorers are now doomed to haunt the area surrounding the site of their betrayal by others."},{"quote":"Passing through the ravine, they came to a hollow, like a small amphitheatre, surrounded by perpendicular precipices, over the brinks of which impending trees shot their branches, so that you only caught glimpses of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud.","desc":"The forest climbing the mountains is portrayed in ever more disorienting language as Rip travels further into it, carrying a keg. The sense that the landscape has become more dreamlike and less recognizable adds emphasis to the strange figures that Rip encounters. The forest has taken him in, ushering Rip into a world completely removed from his own, if only for a while."}]}]
