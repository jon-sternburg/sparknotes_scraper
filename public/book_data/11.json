Alice realizes that she is not just trying to figure\n\t\t\t\t\tout Wonderland, but also attempting to determine who she is and\n\t\t\t\t\twhat constitutes her identity in a world that actively challenges\n\t\t\t\t\ther perspective and sense of self. Wonderland has already begun\n\t\t\t\t\tto affect Alice, and she rightly understands that her self perception\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot remain fixed in a world that has drastically different rules\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom her own. In Wonderland, Alice has a slippery grasp of her identity.\n\t\t\t\t\tSince Wonderland is a byproduct of her own imagination, it becomes\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that it is Alice’s identity and not Wonderland itself that\n\t\t\t\t\tis being called into question. The nonsensical features and characters\n\t\t\t\t\tthat make up Wonderland extend from Alice’s own psyche, so her quest\n\t\t\t\t\tto understand Wonderland becomes a quest to understand the forces\n\t\t\t\t\tand feelings that comprise her identity. The idea of the great puzzle\n\t\t\t\t\talso supports Carroll’s notion that life is an unduly complicated\n\t\t\t\t\tmystery that human beings must use rational thought and intelligence\n\t\t\t\t\tto understand."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/alice/quotes/page/2","quotes":[{"quote":"2.\tLastly, she pictured to herself\n\t\t\t\t\thow this same little sister of hers would, in the after‑time, be\n\t\t\t\t\therself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper\n\t\t\t\t\tyears, the simple and loving heart of her childhood; and how she would\n\t\t\t\t\tgather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright\n\t\t\t\t\tand eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream\n\t\t\t\t\tof Wonderland of long ago; and how she would feel with all their\n\t\t\t\t\tsimple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering\n\t\t\t\t\ther own child‑life, and the happy summer days.","desc":"This quote is the very final sentence\n\t\t\t\t\tof Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. Alice has\n\t\t\t\t\tgone inside for tea, leaving her sister by the riverbank to muse\n\t\t\t\t\tover Alice’s wondrous dream. This passage has a tone of long winded,\n\t\t\t\t\tgolden nostalgia and differs dramatically from the rest of the story,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is generally economical in words and nightmarish for Alice.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis tonal shift results from the shift in perspective from Alice\n\t\t\t\t\tto her sister, which in turn alters the reader’s perception of Alice’s\n\t\t\t\t\tadventures. While she experiences her adventures, Alice finds her\n\t\t\t\t\tjourney to be confounding and nightmarish. On the other hand, Alice’s\n\t\t\t\t\tsister sees her story as a strange tale from a simple heart. She\n\t\t\t\t\ttrivializes Alice’s identity shattering journey, distancing the\n\t\t\t\t\ttrauma Alice experienced in her dream with her own aboveground faith\n\t\t\t\t\tin an orderly universe. In a story studded with subversion, Alice’s\n\t\t\t\t\tsister becomes the ultimate subversion who undermines Alice’s search\n\t\t\t\t\tfor meaning and identity as she imagines Alice growing up and mystifying\n\t\t\t\t\tother simple‑hearted children with her stories.This quote also serves as Carroll’s commentary on the\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter of Alice, the fictionalized version of his muse Alice\n\t\t\t\t\tLiddell. Carroll became deeply preoccupied with the dissolution\n\t\t\t\t\tof his friendship with Liddell as she reached maturity and grew\n\t\t\t\t\tapart from him. This final line has a nostalgic, wistful longing\n\t\t\t\t\tfor “the happy summer days” in which he would visit with the Liddell\n\t\t\t\t\tsisters and delight them “with many a strange tale.” Ultimately,\n\t\t\t\t\tCarroll realizes that these happy summer days cannot last, and like\n\t\t\t\t\tAlice’s dream or even Alice’s sister’s dream, the simple hearted\n\t\t\t\t\tlove of a child will fade, leaving him only with memories of “child‑life.”"}]}]
