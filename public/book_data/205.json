It sums up the prophetic side of Thoreau that many people forget about; he was not just an experimenter living in isolation on Walden Pond, but also a deeply social and morally inspired writer with an ardent message for the masses. His use of the word “desperation” instead of a milder reference to discontentment or unhappiness shows the grimness of his vision of the mainstream American lifestyle. He believes that the monomaniacal pursuit of success and wealth has paradoxically cheapened the lives of those engaged in it, making them unable to appreciate the simpler pleasures enumerated in Walden. But the unpleasantness of American life, according to Thoreau, is more than simply financial or economic, despite the title of his first chapter. “Desperation” is also a word with deep religious connotations, the “lack of hope” that, according to Dante (one of Thoreau’s favorite writers), was inscribed on the gates at hell’s entrance. The Pilgrim’s Progress, John Bunyan’s Protestant spiritual classic and a bestseller in the New England of Thoreau’s day, features a hero who passes through a bleak lowland called the Slough of Despair on his way to meet God. By asserting that most humans have gotten stuck in despair, Thoreau is implying that they are unable to continue farther on their pilgrimage toward true redemption."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden/quotes/page/2","quotes":[{"quote":"So that all the pecuniary outgoes, excepting for washing and mending, which for the most part were done out of the house, and their bills have not yet been received . . . were\n\nHouse, $28 12 1/2\nFarm one year, 14 72 1/2\nFood eight months, 8 74\nClothing &c., eight months, 8 40 3/4\nOil, &c., eight months, 2 00\nIn all, $61 99 3/4","desc":"One of several bookkeeping excerpts\n\t\t\t\t\tincluded in Walden, this one from the chapter “Economy”\n\t\t\t\t\tshows that, as the chapter’s title indicates, Thoreau is not a free\n\t\t\t\t\tspirit fleeing social realities, but on the contrary has a businessman’s\n\t\t\t\t\tsharp eye for financial matters. Indeed, many first-time readers\n\t\t\t\t\tof Walden are surprised to find so much minute\n\t\t\t\t\tfinancial detail in what they expect to be inspirational nature\n\t\t\t\t\twriting. But this is Thoreau’s point: the true inspiration of the\n\t\t\t\t\tspirit does not need to entail financial failure or misery, and\n\t\t\t\t\teconomic and spiritual well-being are two sides of the same coin.\n\t\t\t\t\tSince money is a social rather than a natural phenomenon, we see\n\t\t\t\t\tthe complexity of Thoreau’s turn to nature: he is not really escaping\n\t\t\t\t\tthe world of human values at all, but rather extending it. He defines\n\t\t\t\t\this success in his Walden project not solely in terms of his own\n\t\t\t\t\tspiritual development but also in economic terms—he seeks to live\n\t\t\t\t\twithout incurring debt. Money defines his freedom as much as spiritual\n\t\t\t\t\ttranscendence does.Nonetheless, Thoreau’s account-keeping also reveals the\n\t\t\t\t\tamateur nature of his project, and feeds our underlying knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he is a Harvard man slumming temporarily in the woods rather\n\t\t\t\t\tthan a truly needy person struggling to make ends meet. Any accountant would\n\t\t\t\t\tbe quick to point out Thoreau’s failure to include his laundry bills\n\t\t\t\t\tin his grand total, on the frivolous grounds that they have not come\n\t\t\t\t\tin yet.  He inconsistently lists a year’s rent on the farm, but only\n\t\t\t\t\teight months’ expenditures on food and clothing. If he were truly\n\t\t\t\t\tin need, he might be forced to keep better books; we sense that his\n\t\t\t\t\taccounting, like much of Walden in general, is\n\t\t\t\t\tvisionary fantasy in the guise of fact."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden/quotes/page/3","quotes":[{"quote":"I\n\t\t\t\t\twent to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front\n\t\t\t\t\tonly the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what\n\t\t\t\t\tit had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had\n\t\t\t\t\tnot lived.","desc":"These words provide the answer to the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion posed by the title of Thoreau’s chapter “Where I Lived,\n\t\t\t\t\tand What I Lived For.” The first part of this title is a practical\n\t\t\t\t\tconcern about a place of residence, while the second part is a deeply\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophical concern about the meaning of life. Thoreau combines\n\t\t\t\t\tthe practical and the philosophical in his Walden project, and thus\n\t\t\t\t\tthe phrase “the essential facts of life” can refer both to material\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessities like food and shelter and also to the core of human\n\t\t\t\t\texistence. The double aspect of Walden, its treatment\n\t\t\t\t\tof hard facts as well as philosophical questions, is also evident\n\t\t\t\t\tin his mention of living at the end. Taken factually and literally,\n\t\t\t\t\tit is of course impossible for Thoreau to die understanding that “I\n\t\t\t\t\thad not lived.” But taken philosophically, life means not just biological\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctioning but also inner fulfillment. The experimentalism of Thoreau’s\n\t\t\t\t\tendeavor is expressed in his frank acknowledgement that he is testing\n\t\t\t\t\tout an idea, rather than proving a foregone conclusion. Finally,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe obscure mystical side of Thoreau—which makes him often appear\n\t\t\t\t\tmore of a visionary than a philosopher—is evident in his famous\n\t\t\t\t\tphrase “to live deliberately.” On a literal level, he wishes to\n\t\t\t\t\tchoose his path of life independently and thoughtfully, subject\n\t\t\t\t\tto his own deliberation and no one else’s. But on a higher level,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe phrase is mystical and haunting, since of course nobody ever chooses to\n\t\t\t\t\tlive or deliberately seeks to exist. As elsewhere in the work, Thoreau\n\t\t\t\t\there forces us to contemplate the transcendent meaning of human\n\t\t\t\t\tlife even while we think he is simply referring to a cabin in the\n\t\t\t\t\twoods."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden/quotes/page/4","quotes":[{"quote":"A\n\t\t\t\t\tfield of water betrays the spirit that is in the air. It is continually\n\t\t\t\t\treceiving new life and motion from above. It is intermediate between\n\t\t\t\t\tland and sky.","desc":"This description of Walden Pond from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe chapter entitled “The Ponds” shows how insufficient the label\n\t\t\t\t\t“nature writer” is when applied to the mystical vision of Thoreau\n\t\t\t\t\twhen he regards the landscape around him. It is true that he describes\n\t\t\t\t\tthe flora and fauna of Concord with a level of vibrancy and specificity\n\t\t\t\t\tto which nature writers aspire, but he does more than merely observe\n\t\t\t\t\tand take notes. He also, at times, transforms the physical environment\n\t\t\t\t\tinto a spiritual vision, with religious rather than practical or\n\t\t\t\t\tscientific meaning. Here the phrase “the spirit that is in the air”\n\t\t\t\t\tis more reminiscent of a preacher or poet than a naturalist. It\n\t\t\t\t\tis hard scientifically to define what exactly the “new life” is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat comes to the water from the sky, but in a transcendental, intuitive,\n\t\t\t\t\tspiritual context it makes perfect sense. Even the description of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe pond as an “intermediate between land and sky” has more of an\n\t\t\t\t\tallegorical meaning than a physical one, since in physical terms\n\t\t\t\t\tthe pond is not between land and sky at all. Allegorically,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe pond is the human soul at the juncture between earth and heaven,\n\t\t\t\t\tliving in an earthly realm but reflecting a peaceful world above\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as the pond reflects the sky. Thoreau makes this parallel almost\n\t\t\t\t\texplicit when he compares the depth of the pond to the depth of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe soul."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden/quotes/page/5","quotes":[{"quote":"It\n\t\t\t\t\tis not worth the while to go round the world to count the cats in\n\t\t\t\t\tZanzibar.","desc":"This statement from the “Conclusion”\n\t\t\t\t\tof Walden illustrates another debt on Thoreau’s\n\t\t\t\t\tpart to the American Transcendentalist school of his philosophical\n\t\t\t\t\tmentor, Ralph Waldo Emerson. In Emerson’s influential essay “Self-Reliance,”\n\t\t\t\t\twhich Thoreau’s Walden project could be said to put into practice,\n\t\t\t\t\tEmerson makes the assertion that “travel is a fool’s paradise,”\n\t\t\t\t\tand that it is far more useful to change one’s soul than to change\n\t\t\t\t\tone’s landscape. The fool who thinks that his life will change on\n\t\t\t\t\ta trip to Europe is shocked and disappointed to discover, after\n\t\t\t\t\tunpacking his suitcase on arrival, that he is still in the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttedious company of himself. For Emerson the futility of travel is\n\t\t\t\t\tsimply a consequence of his belief in the centrality of the self—the\n\t\t\t\t\tdepth and health of the soul—in all human affairs. Thoreau inherits\n\t\t\t\t\tthis same belief, downgrading the usual glamour of international\n\t\t\t\t\ttravel (in this case to Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa)\n\t\t\t\t\twith the ridiculous enterprise of counting felines. The point of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis mockery is to point to a better alternative to African voyages. As\n\t\t\t\t\the intimates earlier when he ironically notes that he has traveled a\n\t\t\t\t\tlot in Concord, Thoreau insists that the most valuable kind of travel\n\t\t\t\t\toccurs without leaving one’s hometown: the inward voyage of soul-searching."}]}]
