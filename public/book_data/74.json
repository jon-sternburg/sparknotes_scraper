Spare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. I’m a-laying up sin and suffering for us both, I know. He’s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he’s my own dead sister’s boy, poor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash him, somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks.","desc":"This quotation is from Chapter 1, when Tom has just escaped Aunt Polly’s grasp once again. Aunt Polly’s mixture of amusement and frustration at Tom’s antics is characteristic of her good humor. She attempts to discipline Tom out of a sense of duty more than out of any real indignation. In fact, she often seems to admire Tom’s cleverness and his vivacity. Her inner conflict about her treatment of Tom is summed up in the final sentence of this passage.The faithful re-creation of regional dialects is a characteristic element of Twain’s style. Aunt Polly uses a colloquial vocabulary and pronunciation that may be difficult for a reader unfamiliar with these speech patterns. Twain’s minute attention to language is an important aspect of his realism—–his project of capturing the uniqueness of American frontier life. Twain carefully studied the speech of his local Missouri community and experimented with different ways of rendering it in writing. Furthermore, he attended closely to the internal variations in speech even within such a small town as Hannibal (rendered in his fiction as St. Petersburg). The differences between the language of rich people and poor people, and between the language of Black people and white people, often find expression in Twain’s dialogue. In addition to its distinctive idiom and accent, Aunt Polly’s speech is peppered with clichés and folk wisdom, mixing Scripture and local sayings in a way that gives structure and meaning to her experience."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomsawyer/quotes/page/2","quotes":[{"quote":"“Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you like it?”\nThe brush continued to move.\n“Like it? Well I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?”\nThat put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth—stepped back to note the effect—added a touch here and there—criticized the effect again—Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said:\n“Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.”","desc":"This interchange between Ben Rogers and Tom occurs during the whitewashing episode from Chapter 2. One of Tom’s earliest exploits in the novel, the whitewashing scam gives us a thorough initial look at Tom’s ingenious character. Most evident in this dialogue with Ben Rogers is Tom’s consummate skill as an actor and his instinctive understanding of human behavior. In these moments of prankish virtuosity, Tom always keeps one step ahead of his victims, anticipating their reactions and cornering them verbally into the response he desires. In painting these scenes, Twain draws on the American folk tradition of the trickster. (The Br’er Rabbit tales are another well-known example of this type of story.)This episode also gives Twain a chance to advance the idea that certain values are as much a matter of convention as anything. The moral with which Twain concludes this amusing scene is, “Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and . . . [p]lay consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.” The arbitrariness of many conventions and the absurdity with which people desire things just because they are forbidden are facts of life that Twain scrutinizes again and again in the novel."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomsawyer/quotes/page/3","quotes":[{"quote":"Mr. Walters fell to “showing off,” with all sorts of official bustlings and activities. . . . The librarian “showed off”—running hither and thither with his arms full of books. . . . The young lady teachers “showed off”. . . . The young gentlemen teachers “showed off”. . . . The little girls “showed off” in various ways, and the little boys “showed off” with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur—for he was “showing off,” too.","desc":"This Sunday school scene from Chapter 4 shows the height of Twain’s leveling satire. While Twain makes explicit jabs at the religious spirit and the structures of organized religion elsewhere in the novel, in this scene he directs his mockery toward human nature in a more generalized way. Much of the comic effect of this scene stems from the uniformity of the ridiculous behavior exhibited by teachers, students, boys, and girls. So strong is the human need to impress and to win approval that not even Judge Thatcher is exempt from the temptation to “show off.” Twain suggests that the desire to stand out is universal, which means that in their efforts to distinguish themselves, people wind up all looking alike.For the adults, “showing off” means attempting to conceal the rough edges of their schoolroom establishment, prettifying the Sunday school so that the judge will get an enhanced sense of what is normal there. Such sugarcoating of reality is a particular object of Twain’s contempt, and it is exactly what he does not want his fiction to do. Twain is committed to realism, to depicting the everyday world with all its irregularities and imperfections. In fact, Twain’s penchant for roughness and variation makes his satire more tender and compassionate than it might otherwise be."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomsawyer/quotes/page/4","quotes":[{"quote":"Tom was a glittering hero once more—the pet of the old, the envy of the young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.","desc":"The community’s assessment of Tom in Chapter 24, after his testimony against Injun Joe, implicitly acknowledges the close relationship between Tom’s misbehavior and his heroism. If Tom had not sneaked out at night to carouse in the cemetery with Huck, he would never have been present to witness Dr. Robinson’s murder—as by all rights he should not have been. Tom’s consistently bold and risky behavior puts him in the position to save the day. Distinguishing himself from the conventional, run-of-the-mill behavior that is accepted as the standard in his community is an achievement that cuts both ways, as it makes Tom exceptional in both the good and the bad sense: an extreme character like his is bound to lead either to greatness or to ignominy; as the town puts it, he either will become president or hang."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomsawyer/quotes/page/5","quotes":[{"quote":"Huck Finn’s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas’s protection introduced him into society—no, dragged him into it, hurled him into it—and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The widow’s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed. He had to eat with knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate; he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.","desc":"This passage from Chapter 35 is perhaps the clearest description of the way Huck’s life changes after the Widow Douglas takes him in. Though told by the narrator rather than by Huck himself, the passage nevertheless renders the situation as it appears through Huck’s eyes. This technique—rendering a limited, childish point of view as though it were objective—is one Twain uses throughout the novel to help us identify with the boys more than with the adults of the town. Much of the force of Twain’s heavily nostalgic narrative comes from the way it tugs at the memories most adult readers have stored away, however deeply, of what it was like to be a child. We are thus able to view the events of the novel from a double perspective: from a child’s point of view and from a wider perspective that sees the limitations of that view and, most likely, its charm as well. The ordinary quality of the things the Widow Douglas compels Huck to do is meant to shock us out of our own assumptions. We realize afresh how unorthodox Huck’s life has actually been. This realization in turn forces us to contemplate more intently the way a life of normalcy could feel like a prison after a life of such radical freedom."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomsawyer/quotes/theme/nature","quotes":[{"quote":"Saturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart . . . There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step. The locust trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation, and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful and inviting.","desc":"The theme of nature jumps from the page as Tom reluctantly prepares for his chore of whitewashing the fence and the narrator describes the natural world around him. The narrator describes this Saturday summer morning as bright, beautiful, and inviting. This idyllic setting tempts Tom to abandon the chores forced on him as a punishment and to explore nature. The natural world symbolizes happiness and freedom to Tom Sawyer, tying his character to that of the authentic romantic hero."},{"quote":"There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a woodpecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound. The boy’s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings.","desc":"The narrator explains that Tom, upset after fighting with Becky, runs off to a dense wood to find comfort, demonstrating the importance of nature as inner landscape. Tom reflects on the silent, morose natural setting and feels at one with his surroundings that parallel his self-pitying mood. He envisions lying with the trees and grass in final repose, showing how nature symbolizes comfort and peace to Tom during times of struggle."},{"quote":"It was the cool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not a sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation . . . Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy.","desc":"The narrator describes sunrise, personifying nature as awakening to a work day. Giving nature humanlike qualities strengthens the connection between nature and the boys in this scene. When Tom, Joe Harper, and Huck run away and camp on Jackson’s Island, their entire adventure involves fleeing from civilization and seeking refuge in a natural setting. As Tom wakes in the morning in the woods, the narrator describes his surroundings using words like “delicious,” “calm,” and “cool” to reflect nature’s positive effect."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomsawyer/quotes/theme/youth-and-innocence","quotes":[{"quote":"He worshiped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to “show off” in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time; but by and by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house.","desc":"The narrator describes when Tom sees Becky Thatcher for the first time and expresses his infatuation with exuberance. Tom relies on age-old, “boy meets girl” flirting by pretending to ignore Becky while simultaneously doing his best to get her attention. Instead of just speaking to her to express his interest, he tries to draw her interest through gymnastic moves and stunts. This immature approach to a childish crush speaks to Tom’s youth and innocence."},{"quote":"While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change. They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras—all of them chiefs, of course—and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.","desc":"The narrator’s description of Tom, Huck, and Joe’s childlike, imaginative games while camping on Jackson’s Island reveals the theme of youth and innocence. While the boys chose to run away from the village and initially celebrate their independence, after only a few days, they begin to feel homesick. To distract themselves from their longing for home, they turn to their youthful imaginations and jump into a make-believe world of Indians. Immersing themselves in this imaginary world with costume and play heals their aching hearts for a time."},{"quote":"So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow’s prospects and possibilities there . . . On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again. They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their last hole . . . and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure hunting.","desc":"Tom and Huck’s adventures of treasure hunting and haunted houses, described here by the narrator as serious business, conveys the intensity of childhood. From their imaginative play of Robin Hood to their childlike belief in buried treasure, Tom and Huck exude a contagious youthful innocence and passion for life. While fully absorbed in playing and digging for treasure, their youthful curiosity takes in all their surroundings. A haunted house arouses their enthusiastic superstitions. They end the day content and fulfilled by their adventures as only the young unspoiled by cynicism can feel."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomsawyer/quotes/theme/individualism-versus-conformity","quotes":[{"quote":"The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him.","desc":"Early in the novel, Tom reveals his conflict with societal constraints when Mary requires him to clean and dress well for church. While Tom puts up with the cleaning and dressing, he reflects on how his attire makes him feel trapped and uncomfortable. Worse, Tom despises their destination, Sunday school. He experiences visceral annoyance doing what he doesn’t want to do. Having a strong sense of individuality, Tom struggles with conforming to the expectations of society or anything that represents society, such as church, school, or dressing up."},{"quote":"They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current of a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization . . . They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and ravenous[.]","desc":"Tom, Huck, and Joe have run away to Jackson’s Island, secluding themselves from the village and civilization. As described by the narrator here, in the beginning of this adventure, they feel happy to escape society and its constraints. However, readers learn that the boys become homesick and think about returning, making their choice between individuality and society a real struggle. They must weigh their profound joy and relief of their first days at camp against the comforts of home and family in the village."},{"quote":"He was unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy . . . He said . . . “Don’t talk about it, Tom. I’ve tried it, and it don’t work; it don’t work, Tom. It ain’t for me; I ain’t used to it. The wider’s good to me, and friendly; but I can’t stand them ways[.]”","desc":"Later in the story, the Widow Douglas tries to take in Huck Finn and conform him to civilized ways. However, after only a few weeks, Huck runs away because he’s just not used to living under constraint. Here, Huck tries to explain to Tom why he ran away and how he never wanted to fit into society’s boundaries. Huck’s entire character represents the primacy of the individual over society. Tom will put up with some of society’s constraints, but Huck simply longs to live on his own and do what he wants."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomsawyer/quotes/theme/imagination","quotes":[{"quote":"But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of his life again. What if he turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously? . . . [H]e would join the Indians . . . He would be a pirate! That was it! Now his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable splendor.","desc":"Tom imagines his life away from the village, dreaming about what he could do or become. As he bounces from one idea to another—a clown to an Indian to a pirate—Tom reveals the youthfulness of his imagination. When Tom faces sadness or difficulty, he uses his vivid imagination to escape his current situation and dream about his future. However, his dreams, often not realistic or plausible, distinctly connect to the theme of imagination in this novel."},{"quote":"If you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there . . . Tom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding, but never of its failing before . . . He puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm.","desc":"The theme of imagination rings true through Tom’s strong belief in superstitions. As the narrator explains here, Tom often took part in superstitious acts, such as burying a marble with the hopes that all lost marbles would appear in that spot with just the right magic spell. Clearly, these childlike superstitions require imagination and a desire to believe in the unbelievable. Even when his superstitious ritual fails, Tom holds onto his absurd belief system by blaming the failing marble charm on a witch’s trick."},{"quote":"We got to give this one up. We can’t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing’s too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something’s behind me all the time; and I’m afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there’s others in front a-waiting for a chance[.]","desc":"As Huck talks to Tom during their treasure hunting, the theme of imagination comes through the boys’ active belief in superstitions, witches, ghosts, and haunted houses. To begin with, Tom and Huck time their digging to midnight by the shadow of the tree based only on a superstition they heard that this exact action would help them find a treasure. Then, Huck and Tom both scare themselves by letting their imaginations go wild thinking that ghosts and witches surround them while they dig."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomsawyer/quotes/theme/morality","quotes":[{"quote":"Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.","desc":"The narrator reveals Aunt Polly’s inner turmoil as she becomes conflicted between self-interest and morality. When she falsely accuses Tom of something that Sid did, Aunt Polly realizes her mistake, but feels afraid to apologize as such an action might undermine her authority over Tom. Adults in this story often contradict the code of conduct they impose on the youth, such as following rules and admitting your mistakes. Here, Aunt Polly demonstrates moral cowardice by feeling badly about mistreating Tom but choosing not to own up to her mistake."},{"quote":"Since Tom’s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer’s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck’s confidence in the human race was well-nigh obliterated.","desc":"The narrator describes the scene in which Tom finally tells the truth about what he and Huck saw in the graveyard. Tom’s inner struggle and Huck’s loss of confidence highlight the theme of morality. Despite knowing he made a solemn promise to Huck, Tom’s conscience finally convinces him to tell the truth about Injun Joe murdering the doctor. While this decision brought great mental anguish to both boys, Tom’s actions reveal his good moral character."},{"quote":"A deadly chill went to Huck’s heart—this, then, was the “revenge” job! His thought was to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder her.","desc":"Huck Finn’s morality matures over the course of this novel as he learns to listen to his conscience. After Huck follows Injun Joe and his accomplice from the haunted house and comes across their plan to get “revenge” on the Widow Douglas, he becomes terrified and wants nothing more than to run away. However, as revealed by the narrator here, Huck’s conscience wins over his fear this time as he wants to help the Widow Douglas, who has shown him kindness. Readers later learn that Huck’s actions save Widow Douglas’s life, a clear detail revealing how morality wins over fear."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomsawyer/quotes/character/tom-sawyer","quotes":[{"quote":"Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men’s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling . . . He felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet[.]","desc":"The narrator describes a scene in which Tom Sawyer’s youthful character reveals itself as he becomes easily distracted from his troubles by a new interest in and skill for whistling. Even though these lines compare Tom’s troubles to an adult’s problems, Tom’s solution of whistling symbolizes his youthful spirit. Clearly, Tom Sawyer encounters adversity and gets upset, but ultimately, the resources of youth will win out."},{"quote":"He had had a nice, good idle time all the while—plenty of company—and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn’t run out of whitewash, he would have bankrupted every boy in the village . . . Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it—namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.","desc":"The narrator presents Tom’s mischievous and clever personal qualities when Tom not only finds a way to avoid his fence-painting chore, but also profits off of the evasion. Soon after convincing other boys that he was lucky to have the chance to whitewash the fence, Tom is leisurely watching others work while collecting items from them. While this action reveals Tom’s naughty, lazy character, his intelligence, and ingenuity seem quite impressive."},{"quote":"The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly.","desc":"Tom Sawyer’s character struggles between his individuality and society’s expectations throughout the novel, and as the narrator reveals here, Tom’s aversion to organized religion causes him the most turmoil. Tom sits through church because his aunt and the village as an entity expects him to. However, he does not enjoy standardized prayer, and instead, longs for freedom. Although Tom’s sharp mind unconsciously tracks the preacher’s deviations from ritual, he clearly does not have a focus on religion."},{"quote":"The harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come . . . Tom’s heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.","desc":"Tom’s feelings towards school and studying as revealed by the narrator further display the conflicts his individualism creates with society’s expectations. Even though Aunt Polly and the villagers expect Tom to focus on his education, his mind wanders to anything else, especially an escape to nature and adventure. During this novel’s time period, school consisted of rote learning, leaving no room for imagination or freedom of thought, conflicting entirely with Tom Sawyer’s personality and character."},{"quote":"Tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed a small “branch” two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff Hill, and the schoolhouse was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him.","desc":"The narrator explains how, after a trying day at school and a fight with Becky, Tom escapes to nature, leaving his troubles behind him. In this emotional flight, Tom also reveals his youthful, superstitious beliefs as he crosses an outlet several times to avoid pursuit. By disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff Hill, Tom escapes society, looking to nature for comfort."},{"quote":"Tom’s mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame him for the consequences . . . Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would lead a life of crime.","desc":"Here, Tom’s inner thoughts demonstrate his role as a romantic character through his youthful reaction to life, his vivid imagination, and his reliance on nature for solace. After struggling with various life experiences, Tom jumps to an extreme conclusion, declaring that he will run away and lead a life of crime. Tom’s emotional reaction and eventual escape to become a pirate on Jackson Island support his categorization as a romantic hero."},{"quote":"Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the candlelight with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering. His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought . . . Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips[.]","desc":"As Tom sneaks home during his time away on Jackson Island, he displays his genuine love for his Aunt Polly, as described here by the narrator. As he checks on her and leaves her with a kiss, he clearly feels bad for letting her think he is dead. However, at the same time, Tom’s mischievous and youthful selfishness leads the way in his choosing the fun of a surprise resurrection over relieving Aunt Polly’s grief."},{"quote":"Every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as “feelers”; he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.","desc":"As the murder trial of Muff Potter comes to court, Tom’s suffering conscience also returns. The narrator describes how Tom struggles with not revealing the truth of what happened in the cemetery, displaying his moral character. Not only does Tom worry about being caught lying, he fears Injun Joe’s retaliation and feels guilty about letting Muff Potter take the blame for something Tom knows he did not do."},{"quote":"Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his kite line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off speck that looked like daylight[.]","desc":"The narrator describes the scene in which Tom recounts how he and Becky finally get out of the caves after being lost for days. His elaborate retelling of their adventure reveals Tom’s youthful imagination and hero-like personality as he soaks up the attention of their escape. However, in reality, Tom was a hero, showing genuine love and concern for Becky while demonstrating his creative intelligence and resourcefulness in finding a way out of the caves."},{"quote":"Just as dead earnest as I’m a-sitting here. But Huck, we can’t let you into the gang if you ain’t respectable, you know.","desc":"At the end of the story, Tom Sawyer convinces Huck Finn to return to society by offering him membership in his gang of robbers. While this gang symbolizes individualism, his ultimatum that Huck must be “respectable” to join shows that Tom does value the role of society. Tom has struggled between individualism and society throughout the novel, but he demonstrates his compromise in these final moments."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomsawyer/quotes/character/huckleberry-finn","quotes":[{"quote":"Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like him.","desc":"The narrator’s first description of Huckleberry Finn paints Huck as the epitome of individualism and therefore despised by traditional society. Going against all societal expectations, Huck represents the romantic character that other children want to emulate because he seems different and free and illicit. Tom also gives Huck that role as he seeks out the company of Huck every chance he gets despite being told not to play with him."},{"quote":"Huckleberry was always dressed in the castoff clothes of full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing; the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.","desc":"The narrator’s physical description of Huckleberry Finn gives him the visual complement to his individualistic behavior. Huck’s attire—men’s clothing that appears worn out and ill fitting—doesn’t conform to society’s expected dress for children just as his lifestyle doesn’t suit the village adults."},{"quote":"Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him . . . [H]e was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall . . . In a word, everything that goes to make life precious, that boy had.","desc":"The narrator continues to describe Huckleberry Finn as a character that symbolizes individualism over society. From Huck’s independence to come and go as he pleases, to his image as a romantic hero to every boy in St. Petersburg, Huck has what many individuals crave: freedom. This quote even specifies how Huck does not participate in school or church, two institutions strongly representing society’s expectations."},{"quote":"Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered and started to slink away, but Tom seized him and said: “Aunt Polly, it ain’t fair. Somebody’s got to be glad to see Huck.” . . . [T]he loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.","desc":"When the boys return to the village on the day of their own funerals, the narrator describes how uncomfortable the joyous reception makes Huck Finn. In this moment, the narrator portrays how Huck Finn is not used to being loved or cherished in the way that Tom and Joe have been raised. While at first the unwelcome stares feel difficult for Huck, it’s Aunt Polly’s loving attention that makes Huck most uncomfortable."},{"quote":"Poor Huck was in the same state of wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out yet . . . Since Tom’s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer’s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable oaths, Huck’s confidence in the human race was well-nigh obliterated.","desc":"Here, the narrator describes how Tom’s truth-telling directly affects Huck Finn. To begin with, this truth puts both boys at risk when considering Injun Joe’s fury, even though Tom left Huck’s name out of the account. While Tom’s conscience forces him to tell the truth, in doing so he also breaks an oath that he made with Huck Finn, justifiably shaking Huck’s tenuous trust in others."},{"quote":"[“]We can’t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing’s too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so.

It’s only Huck Finn!” . . . “It’s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!—and welcome!” . . . These were strange words to the vagabond boy’s ears, and the pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before.","desc":"When the old Welshman greets Huck Finn in such a welcoming and inviting way, the narrator describes how surprised Huck feels by this treatment. Huck realizes that these words of welcome have never been used in connection with his name before. However, Huck also describes how pleasant such kind treatment feels.

[T]he bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.","desc":"After Huckleberry Finn becomes a wealthy hero, the Widow Douglas takes him under her wing. While she has good intentions, the narrator describes how she forces Huck into society’s mold.

However, these things only represent imprisonment to an individual like Huck."},{"quote":"Tom, it don’t make no difference. I ain’t everybody, and I can’t stand it. It’s awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy . . . I got to ask to go a-fishing; I got to ask to go in a-swimming—dern’d if I hain’t got to ask to do everything . . .

And now I’ve got you, and you got to settle, you know!","desc":"While in the cemetery as Huck and Tom secretly listen in, Injun Joe turns on Dr. Robinson after digging up a grave. Injun Joe explains to the doctor that he has been holding a grudge against him for five years for mistreating Injun Joe when he asked for something to eat at the doctor’s father’s home.
