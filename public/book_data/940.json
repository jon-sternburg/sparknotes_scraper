I am no scholar, and I care not who knows it; but judging\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom what I have seen, at deer chases and squirrel hunts, of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsparks below, I should think a rifle in the hands of their grandfathers\n\t\t\t\t\twas not so dangerous as a hickory bow and a good flint-head might\n\t\t\t\t\tbe, if drawn with Indian judgment, and sent by an Indian eye.","desc":"Hawkeye makes this pronouncement on\n\t\t\t\t\tIndians in Chapter III in response to Chingachgook’s proposal of\n\t\t\t\t\tracial equality. Hawkeye’s words typify the novel’s ambivalence\n\t\t\t\t\tabout race. On the one hand, Hawkeye expresses surprise that Chingachgook\n\t\t\t\t\tcan “reason,” having equated “red skin” with the absence of intelligence.\n\t\t\t\t\tHawkeye’s insinuation is that Indians are inferior to whites. Yet,\n\t\t\t\t\ton the other hand, a different interpretation of these exact words\n\t\t\t\t\tcould suggest that Hawkeye opposes racism. Hawkeye could mean he\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not understand why most whites think Indians lack reason simply because\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir skin is not white. Hawkeye then praises in exaggerated fashion the fierceness\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Indian’s handmade weapons compared to the power of the white man’s\n\t\t\t\t\trifle. While he expresses his amazement at the Indians’ prowess,\n\t\t\t\t\this praise could be interpreted as condescending. After all, Hawkeye’s\n\t\t\t\t\tpraise of the Indians includes a suggestion that Indians cannot\n\t\t\t\t\toperate rifles. Perhaps Hawkeye approves of the Indians’ skill with\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir quaint toys but operates on the assumption that the whites’\n\t\t\t\t\trifles are far superior if wielded by knowledgeable white men. Like\n\t\t\t\t\tthe novel, Hawkeye expresses tolerance and racism simultaneously."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mohicans/quotes/page/2","quotes":[{"quote":"I\n\t\t\t\t\tam not a prejudiced man, nor one who vaunts himself on his natural\n\t\t\t\t\tprivileges, though the worst enemy I have on earth, and he is an\n\t\t\t\t\tIroquois, daren’t deny that I am genuine white.","desc":"Hawkeye describes himself with these\n\t\t\t\t\twords in Chapter III when Chingachgook asks how white men like Hawkeye\n\t\t\t\t\tknow about Indians. Though The Last of the Mohicans predates\n\t\t\t\t\tscientific knowledge about genetics, Hawkeye comes up with what\n\t\t\t\t\tsounds like a genetic description of the purity of his racial makeup.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe adjective “genuine” suggests sexual purity, foreshadowing the\n\t\t\t\t\tnovel’s later exploration of racial mixing and Hawkeye’s phobic\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse to the possibility of interracial marriage. Hawkeye holds\n\t\t\t\t\tmixed views on race, as these words show. Although he has strong\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendships with many Indian men, here he demonstrates an energetic\n\t\t\t\t\tinsistence on his own “genuine” whiteness. Although he asserts that\n\t\t\t\t\the is not prejudiced, he shows his prejudice by implying he would\n\t\t\t\t\tinjure any man who accused him of having mixed parentage."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mohicans/quotes/page/3","quotes":[{"quote":"A\n\t\t\t\t\tMingo is a Mingo, and God having made him so, neither the Mohawks\n\t\t\t\t\tnor any other tribe can alter him.","desc":"Hawkeye expresses this belief in essential\n\t\t\t\t\tidentity in Chapter IV when waiting to meet the Indian Magua. When\n\t\t\t\t\the learns that Magua is a Huron, Hawkeye immediately pronounces\n\t\t\t\t\tMagua a bad man. Though Hawkeye previously praised individuality,\n\t\t\t\t\there he assigns characteristics to an unknown man based on his race\n\t\t\t\t\tand sect. Hawkeye makes this judgment before meeting the Indian,\n\t\t\t\t\tbasing the judgment on prejudice, not experience. Cooper seems to\n\t\t\t\t\tcriticize Hawkeye’s prejudice, but at the same time he endorses\n\t\t\t\t\tit. After all, the narrative proves Hawkeye right both in his general\n\t\t\t\t\tand his specific prejudices. The Hurons are the villains of the\n\t\t\t\t\tnovel, and Magua is the evilest villain of them all. It turns out\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Hawkeye should suspect Magua of skullduggery, for as early\n\t\t\t\t\tas Chapter IV he has deceived Heyward and the Munro daughters. Cooper\n\t\t\t\t\tcondemns Hawkeye’s racism, but he also writes the plot that justifies that\n\t\t\t\t\tracism."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mohicans/quotes/page/4","quotes":[{"quote":"The\n\t\t\t\t\tHurons love their friends the Delawares. . . . Why should they not?\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are colored by the same sun, and their just men will hunt in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same grounds after death. The redskins should be friends, and\n\t\t\t\t\tlook with open eyes on the white men.","desc":"Magua speaks these words in Chapter\n\t\t\t\t\tXXVIII in an attempt to race-bait and anger the Delaware council.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the novel, racist whites often argue for unity in the face of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir sneaky foes, the Indians. Here, Magua uses the same argument\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst the whites. He argues that the same sun shines on all Indian\n\t\t\t\t\tcultures, and Indians should unite against the untrustworthy white\n\t\t\t\t\tman. Magua turns the stereotype on its head by suggesting that the\n\t\t\t\t\tIndians, not the whites, have something to fear from a shiftless\n\t\t\t\t\trace. Cooper presents Magua’s words as nothing more than a calculated\n\t\t\t\t\tattempt to stir up the emotions of the Delawares. However, outside\n\t\t\t\t\tthe world of the novel, Magua’s words take on another meaning. Cooper\n\t\t\t\t\twrote during a time when the U.S. government carried out a policy\n\t\t\t\t\tof exterminating Native American peoples. Although Magua speaks\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom personal malice, the words he speaks should be heeded by all\n\t\t\t\t\tIndians who must live in fear of the conquest of their white oppressors."}]},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mohicans/quotes/page/5","quotes":[{"quote":"The\n\t\t\t\t\tpale-faces are masters of the earth, and the time of the red-men\n\t\t\t\t\thas not yet come again. My day has been too long.","desc":"The Delaware patriarch Tamenund speaks\n\t\t\t\t\tthese words in the final chapter of the novel, lamenting Uncas’s\n\t\t\t\t\tdeath. His words clarify the meaning of the title The Last\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Mohicans. Tamenund describes the pain of his old\n\t\t\t\t\tage. He has lived through three generations of Delaware warriors\n\t\t\t\t\tand has witnessed the death of the “last of the Mohicans”; survival\n\t\t\t\t\thas become not a triumph but a burden. You live too long, he suggests,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen you are able to witness the extinction of an entire group of\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople. Although Tamenund speaks mournfully, a spark of hope comes\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the words “not yet.” Tamenund implies that though the white\n\t\t\t\t\tmen now dominate the land, the progress of history is cyclical and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the Indian people will eventually rise to power again."}]}]
