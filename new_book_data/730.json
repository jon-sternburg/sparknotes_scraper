The function of this description is twofold: first, to provoke our sympathies for young Oliver and his fellow unfortunates, and second, to register Dickens’s protest against the welfare policy and practice of charity in the England of his time. Three years before the publication of Oliver Twist, the British Parliament passed a controversial amendment to the nation’s “poor-laws.” This amendment stipulated that the poor could receive public assistance only if they took up residence in official workhouses and abided by their regulations. In these workhouses, husbands were separated from wives, and living conditions were often abysmal. Lurking behind the establishment of workhouses were the assumptions that moral virtue lay in work, that work led necessarily to success, that economic failure was the result of laziness, and that, therefore, poverty was a sign of moral degeneracy. In Dickens’s opinion, charity based on this kind of premise did far more harm than good to the material and moral situations of its recipients. In this passage, and throughout the early chapters of the novel, he adopts a sarcastic, harshly satirical tone to make this point. Dickens, in fact, says the exact opposite of what he really means and does no more than state the truth. All of the conditions he describes did actually exist. Rather than exaggerating to make his point, Dickens relies on the inherent absurdity of the way English society treated the poor to manifest itself through his description."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/page/2","quote":"Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft tranquility, the sickly boy fe","desc":"In Dickens’s time, England was rapidly becoming an industrial, urban society. Dickens’s works are overwhelmingly concerned with the social and psychological conditions that city life fostered, and he is known as one of the first great urban European authors. Yet, in this passage from Chapter 32, describing Oliver’s sojourn to the countryside with Mrs. Maylie and Rose, the author reveals his profound skepticism about the influence of urban life on the human character. This passage praises the purity and health of the rural environment and claims outright that even a lifelong city-dweller has in his blood a faint longing for the “new state of being” to which nature can elevate him. Dickens goes on to note that, in the country, even “the poor people” are “neat and clean.” The squalor and starvation that characterize urban poverty are not present in rural England. Given the eagerness of England’s rural poor to migrate to the city, it seems unlikely that this assessment is realistic. In many ways, Dickens’s idealized vision marks him all the more clearly as an urban writer, since his gritty portraits of city life are based on real experience, while his blissful portrait of rural life seems more the product of wistful fantasy."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/page/3","quote":"“Stay another moment,” interposed Rose....“Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man,","desc":"This exchange takes place between Rose and Nancy in Chapter 40. It is one of the most emotionally heightened conversations in the novel, and it represents a sophisticated treatment of the moral and social issues that dominate the story. Nancy, a prostitute, embodies for Dickens all the degradation into which poverty can force otherwise good people. Rose, on the other hand, represents all the purity that comes from good breeding. Both women embody the feminine compassion that compels them to help Oliver. That feminine compassion, maternal and sisterly when directed toward Oliver, is also what binds Nancy to her vice-ridden lover Sikes. In this passage, Dickens emphasizes the key role that environment plays in distinguishing vice from virtue: the same loyalty to a loved one that would be a virtue in Rose is a self-destructive force for Nancy. Though Nancy is compassionate and intelligent, she deflects Rose’s attempts to save her from her life of crime, thus proving that the damage done by a bad upbringing is irrevocable. Yet Nancy’s decision to return to a life of “vice” is arguably the most noble—if foolhardy—act in the entire novel. Her love for Sikes and her compassion for Oliver together compel her to sacrifice her own life. Though Dickens clearly approves of the second emotion far more than the first, it is likely that they stem from the same impulse in Nancy’s character."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/page/4","quote":"At times he [Sikes] turned with desperate determination, resolved to beat this phantom off, though i","desc":"After murdering Nancy, Sikes flees London, only to find that his conscience will not let him escape. This passage, from Chapter 48, embodies an idea that has fascinated many great authors—the idea that a guilty conscience is its own punishment, worse than any that the law can assign. The entire account of Sikes’s flight is also among the most psychologically sophisticated passages in the novel. Up until this point, Sikes has been a pure villain. In his guilt, however, he becomes more realistically human. We probably cannot sympathize with Sikes, but, in this chapter, we do see the world through his wretched eyes. Moreover, Dickens’s vivid descriptions allow us to experience Sikes’s sensation of being hunted, by both external and more horrifying internal pursuers."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/page/5","quote":"I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and grat","desc":"The final passage of the novel sums up Dickens’s moral and religious vision. On the one hand, Dickens considers a firm and true belief in God to be an essential prerequisite of both moral rectitude and earthly happiness. On the other hand, the novel has not been kind to characters such as Mr. Bumble, who prattle on about Christian values, but whose behavior is notably lacking in “Benevolence” and who are quick to condemn others as sinners. The description of Agnes’s grave is an attack on puritanical religion, which would consider adultery to be an unforgivable sin. The novel’s faith in Christian values is as wholehearted as its attacks on Christian hypocrisy are biting."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/theme/purity","quote":"The blessing was from a young child’s lips, but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked ","desc":"The narrator describes the scene when, en route to London, Oliver comes across Dick, a dying boy from the farm, who wishes him well with God’s blessing. This scene demonstrates the purity both orphan boys naturally possess. Touched by the gesture, Oliver remains devoted to Dick and, when he achieves security with Rose and Mr. Brownlow, longs to rescue Dick. For his part, Dick cares little about his own grim future and follows his instinct to show Oliver that he cares. The boys’ compassion and mutual devotion refute the premise put forth by many characters in the novel that poor people are corrupt and bound for criminality."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/theme/purity","quote":"This sounded so like a falsehood that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in Oliver’s face.

As the narrator explains here, Mr. Brownlow finds this story suspicious but instead of putting his faith in the words of others, he looks to Oliver and sees only honesty and trustworthiness. In the novel, Oliver himself embodies purity and goodness. The people who likewise possess these qualities, like Mr. Brownlow and Rose, instantly recognize them in Oliver. Corrupt people like Fagin and Sikes believe they can pervert his innate nature."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/theme/purity","quote":"“Sit down,” said Rose, earnestly. “If you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to reli","desc":"Upon meeting Nancy for the first time, Rose displays selfless kindness that Nancy’s obviously low station in life barely merits. Unlike the hotel employees, Rose does not focus on Nancy’s looks, dress, or doubtful character. Instead, she senses that Nancy feels deeply troubled and, without even knowing the cause, vows to help in any way she can. Like her brother Oliver, Rose embodies goodness and, through her association with Mrs. Maylie, she has the means to act upon her best intentions."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/theme/poverty","quote":"[H]e should be despatched to a branch-workhouse...where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders ag","desc":"The narrator explains how the system punishes Oliver and the other orphans for the “crime” of being born poor. Throughout Oliver Twist, Dickens links poverty and criminality, but unfortunately, children like Oliver have virtually no opportunity to raise themselves and their station. The poor children who don’t die on the farms find themselves shipped to the workhouses, where they become entrenched in a cycle of hunger and poverty. As evidenced by boys like the Artful Dodger, few decent lines of work exist for poor, illegitimate children. Oliver can only improve himself through the kindness of others who react to his innate goodness."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/theme/poverty","quote":"What have paupers to do with soul or spirit?

His words highlight two key ideas about poverty. First, the sentiment justifies the decision to place orphans and other impoverished people on the farms and in the workhouses. The perverse logic follows that unless downtrodden people stay weak, they will revolt against their conditions. Secondly, the rationalization serves to keep poor people in such a state for their lifespans. Poor people unable to obtain proper nourishment will lack the energy to work hard enough to improve their situation."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/theme/poverty","quote":"Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and mis","desc":"In an ironic turn, due to their role in hiding Oliver’s true identity, the narrator explains how the Bumbles lose their position at the workhouse and get sent there as inmates themselves. This reversal of fortune plays with the argument that poor people have done something to merit their bleak situation. While the Bumbles brought about their own sorry fate—their avarice leads them to sell information about Agnes’s locket for twenty-five pounds—most of the impoverished people in the novel, like Oliver and Nancy, are simply born into unfortunate circumstances. The Bumbles may be the only occupants in the workhouse who deserve to be there."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/theme/criminality","quote":"And it’s a great deal better, Work’us, that she died when she did, or else she’d have been hard labo","desc":"Noah Claypole, an apprentice himself, taunts Oliver, saying that if his mother had not died she would likely be in prison or hanged as a criminal. Even a youth such as Noah, a recipient of charity himself, accepts the links that Victorian society makes between poverty and criminality. That Oliver rises to Noah’s bait and attacks him in rage only validates these fallacies that the people believe. By attacking Noah, Oliver demonstrates violent behavior, which supports the idea that poor people, like him and his mother, are criminals at heart."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/theme/criminality","quote":"He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and money; gambled, squandered, forged, an","desc":"As a foil to Oliver and his purity, Monks and his degradation demonstrate that criminality spans wealth and social class. As described here by the narrator, even though Monks has socially respectable, well-off parents, he acts like a born criminal. Life offered Monks advantages that no one in Fagin’s gang could imagine—including an inheritance. Instead, Monks chose to spend much of his life in the company of criminals. He shows no interest in repentance, even when confronted by Mr. Brownlow, who treats him with kindness. In the end, despite starting afresh in the New World, Monks returns to his old ways and dies in prison."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/theme/criminality","quote":"Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes’s crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest l","desc":"The narrator reports that Charley has turned his back on his life of crime and ends up a cattle farmer. This detail refutes many of the preconceived notions of criminality and class in Victorian England. In choosing to change his ways, Charley proves that criminals can repent and find redemption. Charley’s transformation, through dint of hard work and determination, also demonstrates that criminality is not innate. If poor people were born to a criminal destiny, they would not have the ability to shake off such habits."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/quotes/theme/class","quote":"Wrapped in the blanket...he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been ","desc":"Early in the story, while describing baby Oliver, the narrator calls into question stereotypes of social class as mere constructs of society. Wrapped in a blanket, no person examining Oliver could judge if his mother were rich or poor, of upper or lower class.

And yet, as explained here by the narrator, when he comes into contact with the orphaned Oliver, he immediately delights in picking on the younger boy. Noah’s cruel attitude likely derives from the taunting he himself receives from the shop boys, who make fun of him because of his lack of money and station. Nevertheless, this pecking order shows the inherently unfair use of social class as an indicator of an individual’s character.
