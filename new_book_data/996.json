For no","desc":"In this quotation from Chapter XXV of the First Part, Don Quixote explains to Sancho that the actual behavior of the farmer’s daughter, Aldonza Lorenzo, does not matter as long as he can imagine her perfectly as his princess, Dulcinea del Toboso. This idea of Dulcinea figures prominently in the novel, since we never actually meet Dulcinea, and she likely does not even know about Don Quixote’s patronage. Don Quixote’s imagination compensates for many holes in the novel’s narration, providing explanations for inexplicable phenomena and turning apparently mundane events into great adventures. Dulcinea gains renown through Don Quixote’s praise, and regardless of whether she is even real, she exists in fame and in the imaginations of all the characters who read about her. In this way, Don Quixote’s imaginings take on the force of reality and he becomes, effectively, the narrator of his own fate."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/donquixote/quotes/page/2","quote":"I shall never be fool enough to turn knight-errant. For I see quite well that it’s not the fashion n","desc":"In this passage from Chapter XXXII of the First Part, the innkeeper responds to the priest, who has been trying to convince him that books of chivalry are not true. Though the innkeeper defends the books, he says that he will never try to live like Don Quixote because he realizes that knight-errantry is outdated. The innkeeper’s remark is important for several reasons. First, it inspires Sancho, who overhears the remark, to resolve—as he does at so many points throughout the novel—to return to his wife and children because knight-errantry has fallen out of fashion. The fact that Sancho does not leave Don Quixote becomes even more poignant when juxtaposed with his temptations to leave.Second, this quotation highlights the priest’s hypocritical nature. The innkeeper appreciates knight-errantry from a distance, but the priest, who plays the role of inquisitor against Don Quixote throughout much of the novel, cannot escape his fascination with knight-errantry. The priest furtively encourages Don Quixote’s madness so that he may live vicariously through him."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/donquixote/quotes/page/3","quote":"Now that I’ve to be sitting on a bare board, does your worship want me to flay my bum?","desc":"Sancho puts this question to Don Quixote in Chapter XLI of the Second Part, after Don Quixote suggests that Sancho whip himself to free Dulcinea from her alleged enchantment. With these words, which display his sarcastic wit, skepticism, and insubordinate nature, Sancho refuses to obey Don Quixote’s order. The tale of Dulcinea’s enchantment literally comes back to bite Sancho in the rear end—Sancho originally tells Don Quixote that Dulcinea is enchanted in an effort to hide the fact that he does not know where she lives and what she looks like. Sancho’s lie nearly catches up with him a number of times until the Duchess finally snares him completely, telling him that Dulcinea actually has been enchanted. Sancho gullibly believes her story and later agrees to whip himself 3,300 times in order to revoke Dulcinea’s enchantment. Nonetheless, Sancho is not happy with this course of action, and in the end he stands up to Don Quixote about it. This quotation not only fleshes out Sancho’s character but also exemplifies the bawdy humor that pervades Don Quixote. Deeply ironic and complex, the novel is also very funny."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/donquixote/quotes/page/4","quote":"Great hearts, my dear master, should be patient in misfortune as well as joyful in prosperity. And t","desc":"Sancho’s final words of wisdom to Don Quixote, which appear in Chapter LXVI of the Second Part, caution Don Quixote to be patient even in his retirement. Sancho’s statement marks the complete reversal of his and Don Quixote’s roles as servant and master. Throughout the novel, Don Quixote determines Sancho’s role as a squire while teaching Sancho the chivalric philosophy that drives him. Now, however, Sancho consoles Don Quixote with the simple wisdom he has gained from his own experiences. Interestingly, Sancho still calls Don Quixote “dear master,” even though he is no longer truly in Don Quixote’s service. Resigned to his humble station in life, he is not only simple and loyal but also wise and gentle."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/donquixote/quotes/page/5","quote":"For me alone Don Quixote was born and I for him. His was the power of action, mine of writing.","desc":"These parting words of Cide Hamete Benengeli, in Chapter LXXIV of the Second Part, reflect Cervantes’s words at the novel’s beginning. At the start, Cervantes declares that Don Quixote is only his stepson—in other words, that he is not fully responsible for creating the character of Don Quixote. Don Quixote’s real father, according to Cervantes’s account, is Benengeli, the Moor from whose manuscript Cervantes claims to translate Don Quixote. Such remarks give the text a mythical, unreal tone that leaves us unsure whom to trust or to whom to attribute the story of Don Quixote. Additionally, the powerful sentiment that Benengeli expresses here contributes to the novel’s claim that Don Quixote was a real person. Benengeli de-emphasizes his role in bringing Don Quixote’s story to light by casting himself as a mere recorder of a great man’s life and deeds."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/donquixote/quotes/theme/madness","quote":"The poor gentleman lost his senses, in poring over, and attempting to discover the meaning of these ","desc":"The narrator describes how Don Quixote’s obsession with stories of chivalry has driven him mad, to an extent that even a great philosopher would not be able to understand or explain. Even before Don Quixote’s adventures begin, readers get a sense of just how removed from reality he has become.

His listeners oscillate between appreciation for Don Quixote’s command of logic and history and shock at his ravings as he becomes more passionate about chivalry. Although Don Quixote engages in many ridiculous acts throughout the story, he has studied the subject of knighthood so closely that he can make completely rational arguments due to his vast knowledge on the topic.

His advice spans the subjects of what sort of women to marry, how to treat criminals, and how to confront enemies. By posing this question, the narrator contrasts Don Quixote’s rational discourse with his actions in the rest of the novel. The narrator points out that when Don Quixote discusses anything but chivalry, he appears completely intelligible and sensible.

Sancho comes from the peasant class, but Don Quixote goes out of his way to put himself on equal footing with Sancho, saying that a knight’s tradition demands he treat everyone the same regardless of circumstances.

He asks Don Quixote to give details of the woman he loves. Vivaldo wants to know her name, origin, and station rather than the reasons why Don Quixote cares for her. Vivaldo later says, “I wish we knew her lineage, race, and family.” Such a comment reveals that Vivaldo feels more concern for the woman’s match to Don Quixote in terms of class than compatibility."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/donquixote/quotes/theme/class","quote":"Never think of that, Sancho! cried Teresa, match her with her equal; which will be more prudent than","desc":"Sancho’s wife, Teresa, protests Sancho’s declaration that he plans to find a husband with a high station for their daughter, Mari. Society at that time viewed Sancho and his family as peasants. Understanding how status affects their reality, Teresa lays out how Mari would not be prepared for life in a different class of society. Teresa’s reaction shows that not only members of the upper class wish for tradition and status to remain in place. Members of lower classes seem to be comfortable in their stations as well and understand the difficulties that might arise with attempts to move above the status quo."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/donquixote/quotes/theme/morality","quote":"Intoxicated with these, and other such promises, Sancho Panza (so was the countryman called) deserte","desc":"Don Quixote recruits Sancho as his squire by promising to bring him wealth and one day make him governor of an island.

He sees the guards as usurping God’s role as judge, reminds them that they weren’t victimized by their crimes, and appeals to them to abandon their duly-appointed duty to convey the prisoners to justice. The prisoners eventually escape, stealing Don Quixote’s and Sancho’s belongings.
