Si peccasse negamus, fallimur, et nulla est in nobis verita","desc":"Faustus speaks these lines near the end of his opening soliloquy. In this speech, he considers various fields of study one by one, beginning with logic and proceeding through medicine and law. Seeking the highest form of knowledge, he arrives at theology and opens the Bible to the New Testament, where he quotes from Romans and the first book of John. He reads that “[t]he reward of sin is death,” and that “[i]f we say we that we have no sin, / We deceive ourselves, and there’s no truth in us.” The logic of these quotations—everyone sins, and sin leads to death—makes it seem as though Christianity can promise only death, which leads Faustus to give in to the fatalistic “What will be, shall be! Divinity, adieu!” However, Faustus neglects to read the very next line in John, which states, “If we confess our sins, [God] is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9). By ignoring this passage, Faustus ignores the possibility of redemption, just as he ignores it throughout the play. Faustus has blind spots; he sees what he wants to see rather than what is really there. This blindness is apparent in the very next line of his speech: having turned his back on heaven, he pretends that “[t]hese metaphysics of magicians, / And necromantic books are heavenly.” He thus inverts the cosmos, making black magic “heavenly” and religion the source of “everlasting death.”"},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/page/2","quote":"MEPHASTOPHILIS: Why this is hell, nor am I out of it. Think’st thou that I, who saw the face of God,","desc":"This exchange shows Faustus at his most willfully blind, as he listens to Mephastophilis describe how awful hell is for him even as a devil, and as he then proceeds to dismiss Mephastophilis’s words blithely, urging him to have “manly fortitude.” But the dialogue also shows Mephastophilis in a peculiar light. We know that he is committed to Faustus’s damnation—he has appeared to Faustus because of his hope that Faustus will renounce God and swear allegiance to Lucifer. Yet here Mephastophilis seems to be urging Faustus against selling his soul, telling him to “leave these frivolous demands, / Which strike a terror to my fainting soul.” There is a parallel between the experience of Mephastophilis and that of Faustus. Just as Faustus now is, Mephastophilis was once prideful and rebelled against God; like Faustus, he is damned forever for his sin. Perhaps because of this connection, Mephastophilis cannot accept Faustus’s cheerful dismissal of hell in the name of “manly fortitude.” He knows all too well the terrible reality, and this knowledge drives him, in spite of himself, to warn Faustus away from his t-errible course."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/page/3","quote":"MEPHASTOPHILIS.: Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed In one self-place; for where we are is he","desc":"This exchange again shows Mephastophilis warning Faustus about the horrors of hell. This time, though, their exchange is less significant for what Mephastophilis says about hell than for Faustus’s response to him. Why anyone would make a pact with the devil is one of the most vexing questions surrounding Doctor Faustus, and here we see part of Marlowe’s explanation. We are constantly given indications that Faustus doesn’t really understand what he is doing. He is a secular Renaissance man, so disdainful of traditional religion that he believes hell to be a “fable” even when he is conversing with a devil. Of course, such a belief is difficult to maintain when one is trafficking in the supernatural, but Faustus has a fallback position. Faustus takes Mephastophilis’s assertion that hell will be “[a]ll places … that is not heaven” to mean that hell will just be a continuation of life on earth. He fails to understand the difference between him and Mephastophilis: unlike Mephastophilis, who has lost heaven permanently, Faustus, despite his pact with Lucifer, is not yet damned and still has the possibility of repentance. He cannot yet understand the torture against which Mephastophilis warns him, and imagines, fatally, that he already knows the worst of what hell will be."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/page/4","quote":"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen","desc":"These lines come from a speech that Faustus makes as he nears the end of his life and begins to realize the terrible nature of the bargain he has made. Despite his sense of foreboding, Faustus enjoys his powers, as the delight he takes in conjuring up Helen makes clear. While the speech marks a return to the eloquence that he shows early in the play, Faustus continues to display the same blind spots and wishful thinking that characterize his behavior throughout the drama. At the beginning of the play, he dismisses religious transcendence in favor of magic; now, after squandering his powers in petty, self-indulgent behavior, he looks for transcendence in a woman, one who may be an illusion and not even real flesh and blood. He seeks heavenly grace in Helen’s lips, which can, at best, offer only earthly pleasure. “[M]ake me immortal with a kiss,” he cries, even as he continues to keep his back turned to his only hope for escaping damnation—namely, repentance."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/page/5","quote":"Ah Faustus, Now hast thou but one bare hour to live, And then thou must be damned perpetually... The","desc":"These lines come from Faustus’s final speech, just before the devils take him down to hell. It is easily the most dramatic moment in the play, and Marlowe uses some of his finest rhetoric to create an unforgettable portrait of the mind of a man about to carried off to a horrific doom. Faustus goes from one idea to another, desperately seeking a way out. But no escape is available, and he ends by reaching an understanding of his own guilt: “No, Faustus, curse thy self, curse Lucifer, / That hath deprived thee of the joys of heaven.” This final speech raises the question of why Faustus does not repent earlier and, more importantly, why his desperate cries to Christ for mercy are not heard. In a truly Christian framework, Faustus would be allowed a chance at redemption even at the very end. But Marlowe’s play ultimately proves more tragic than Christian, and so there comes a point beyond which Faustus can no longer be saved. He is damned, in other words, while he is still alive.Faustus’s last line aptly expresses the play’s representation of a clash between Renaissance and medieval values. “I’ll burn my books,” Faustus cries as the devils come for him, suggesting, for the first time since scene 2, when his slide into mediocrity begins, that his pact with Lucifer is about gaining limitless knowledge, an ambition that the Renaissance spirit celebrated but that medieval Christianity denounced as an expression of sinful human pride. As he is carried off to hell, Faustus seems to give in to the Christian worldview, denouncing, in a desperate attempt to save himself, the quest for knowledge that has defined most of his life."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/sin-versus-redemption","quote":"What, is great Mephostophilis so passionate For being deprivèd of the joys of heaven?

The theme of sin versus redemption plays out through Faustus’s decision to ignore the warnings and choose sin, making a deal with Lucifer, over the joys of heaven. Faustus surrenders his good soul in order to gain the power of having Mephostophilis at his beck and call.

In these lines, Faustus presents the theme of Medieval versus Renaissance as he dismisses religion and moves toward individualism, science, and black magic. During the time period of this play, most people possessed a Medieval focus, looking to God and religion only. However, here Faustus literally says goodbye to divinity and makes a Renaissance decision to seek learning and dark magic to further his individual power and profit."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/medieval-versus-renaissance","quote":"Learnèd Faustus, To find the secrets of astronomy Graven in the book of Jove’s high firmament, Did m","desc":"Here, the Chorus reveals to the audience how Faustus has spent his time since making his bargain with the devil. These lines describe Faustus’s focus on learning as he studies astronomy and other sciences. This educational tour represents Faustus’s transition from a Medieval focus on god to a Renaissance emphasis on learning and individualism. At the same time, the Chorus describes Faustus sitting in a bright chariot carried by dragons, also symbolizing the dark magic and Renaissance individualism accompanying Faustus on his quest for learning."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/medieval-versus-renaissance","quote":"Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight And burnèd is Apollo’s laurel bough That someo","desc":"As the Chorus concludes the play, these lines identify a moral lesson being taught through Faustus’s fall from heaven. As the Chorus describes how “learnèd” Faustus fell because he looked to dark magic and evil rather than following God’s way, the theme of Medieval versus Renaissance shines through one more time. However, in this final moral lesson, the Chorus instructs the audience to be wary of the Renaissance movement, using Faustus as an example of what not to do in the search for knowledge and happiness."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/power-and-ambition","quote":"Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please?

In these lines, Faustus responds to Mephostophilis’ agreement by describing how much power and wealth he will gain through this deal with the devil. When Faustus lists how far he will go with Mephostophilis’ help, he demonstrates the toxic effects of power and ambition on a man because he freely gives up his good soul for his blinding greed."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/power-and-ambition","quote":"Bad Angel.

Here, Faustus discusses his reasoning for gravitating toward magic over other subjects, such as physics and divinity. Ultimately, Faustus makes clear that he feels empowered to choose his next step in life. Therefore, in this beginning section of the play, Faustus exercises his free will as he chooses his next steps.

While he has been contemplating trying magic, in this quote, Faustus finally takes the leap and begins to conjure evil spirits.

Here, Mephostophilis performs a magic spell to make Faustus invisible. Once again, the rhythmic, descriptive language in these lines clearly reveals the spell’s connection to magic and darkness. This scene shows how Faustus relies on Mephostophilis’ magic to achieve his mischievous and ambitious desires, which ultimately forever binds Faustus to his darkness."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/dark-magic","quote":"Emperor.

Even though dark magic can conjure spirits and give Faustus notoriety, such magic produces effects that lack substance and cannot be embraced.
