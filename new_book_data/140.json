[{"page":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jungle/quotes/","quote":"Here was a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation, and ","desc":"This quote from Chapter 10 comes from Sinclair’s explanation of Ona’s working conditions; she is forced to work under Miss Henderson, who runs a prostitution ring, and most of her coworkers are prostitutes. Sinclair presents these conditions as a horrible situation for the modest, moral Ona but also offers an explanation in which the system of prostitution is examined in rough economic terms. As with every other failing among the working class in the novel, prostitution is shown not as an innate fault of the women involved but rather as the fault of the capitalists and the economic oppression that they force upon the impoverished immigrants. This passage also hints at the sexual oppression that young working girls are forced to endure from their bosses and foreshadows Ona’s rape at the hands of Phil Connor.Additionally, the last sentence raises a Marxist argument about the appearance of calm surrounding social relations under capitalism. The argument runs that social relations under capitalism are no less exploitative than those that existed under slavery and in feudal societies but that capitalism conceals the true turbulent nature of these relationships under a veneer of naturalness and inevitability. The difference between wage labor and these antiquated forms of subjugation is only a matter of transparency; though the “difference in color between master and slave” is no longer applicable to the owner-laborer relationship, the oppression remains the same."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jungle/quotes/page/2","quote":"[T]he meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift","desc":"This long description from Chapter 14 is among the most famous and influential passages in the novel and helps to explain why the book caused so much public furor upon its publication. Sinclair intended the book to raise public consciousness about the plight of the working poor, but he relied on a pseudo-naturalistic technique that emphasized the physically revolting filth and gore of the stockyards. As a result, the novel caused outrage about the unsanitary quality of the meat that was sold in stores rather than the oppression of the poor. The public pressed less for the socialist reforms that Sinclair backed than the public reform to food laws. The image of all kinds of waste being dumped in with the consumer’s product is surely revolting; that it is dumped in without any regard for the consumer by greedy capitalists is infuriating. Sinclair himself stated: “I aimed at the public’s heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach.”"},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jungle/quotes/page/3","quote":"They put him in a place where the snow could not beat in, where the cold could not eat through his b","desc":"This quote from Chapter 16 explains Jurgis’s mindset when he is sent to prison after attacking Phil Connor. Ironically, to Jurgis, the prison is actually an environment far preferable to the cruel, filthy world of Packingtown. Here he receives shelter from the elements and food without having to do anything; he believes that his family members are the real prisoners, as, without his support, they now face starvation and eviction. It is a measure of Jurgis’s sympathy and of the horrible conditions that the family is forced to endure that Jurgis actually wishes that his family were sent to prison in his place. Additionally, Jurgis’s rhetorical question at the end of the quote speaks to the cold and unsympathetic nature of capitalism: if the women and children cannot earn the means to survive, it is because they aren’t productive enough as laborers."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jungle/quotes/page/4","quote":"All day long the blazing midsummer sun beat down upon that square mile of abominations: upon tens of","desc":"This descriptive passage from Chapter 26 portrays the rank and festering physical environment in which the Packingtown laborers are forced to live, helping to explain why Jurgis found prison so preferable. The passage also shows off the lurid, pseudo-naturalistic style that Sinclair adopted for the novel, which matches his flair for physical description with his desire to shock and disgust his readers. He captures the disgusting filth and general unbearableness of Packingtown in the images of “floors [that] stank and steamed contagion” and “blistering...railroad tracks.” Furthermore, he breaks down the meat-packing plant into the raw, nauseating elements of “rivers of hot blood” and “carloads of moist flesh.” This repulsiveness plagues not only the factories but also the laborers and their living quarters; they have “greasy laundry” and sordid bathrooms. Sinclair deliberately makes his readers feel uncomfortable in the hopes of stirring up their sympathy, and The Jungle is full of vivid and stomach-churning passages such as this one."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jungle/quotes/page/5","quote":"To Jurgis the packers had been equivalent to fate; Ostrinski showed him that they were the Beef Trus","desc":"This quote from Chapter 29 illustrates the effect of Jurgis’s adoption of socialism upon his mind. He previously considers the capitalists “equivalent to fate,” believing them to be all-powerful, impersonal, inhuman forces that have total control over his life. But Ostrinski convinces him that the capitalists are merely corrupt human beings who immorally oppress other human beings. Jurgis realizes here that the only difference between the capitalists and the workers lies in money, for while the capitalists have “a gigantic combination of capital,” the workers have nothing. But, as the speech at the end of the novel emphasizes, there are many more workers than capitalists, which could enable the socialist party to overthrow the hegemony of capitalism in a democratic system. This quote demonstrates the opening of Jurgis’s mind to politics and economics, as he takes up the socialist cause with a fervor at least as strong as that with which he initially embraces capitalism and the American Dream."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jungle/quotes/theme/capitalism","quote":"Here was Durham’s, for instance, owned by a man who was trying to make as much money out of it as he","desc":"Tamoszius explains to Jurgis how the meatpacking factories work. According to Tamoszius, the factory owners are only concerned with making money and do not care how the workers are treated or about the quality of the products. Perhaps he unknowingly describes the dangers of capitalism, or how greed for money at the higher levels of society can cause the working class to suffer. Not only do the workers suffer financially and physically, but they feel isolated and competitive as they do not want anyone to surpass them and take their job."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jungle/quotes/theme/capitalism","quote":"The city, which was owned by an oligarchy of business men, being nominally ruled by the people, a hu","desc":"The narrator describes how, when Jurgis turns to a life of crime, he sees the widespread corruption in Chicago’s politics. While he and his family once saw America as a place of freedom, where citizens had a say in their elections, he now understands that money controls everything.

Even though the workers far outnumber the capitalists, workers are dependent on jobs provided by the capitalists for money, while capitalists retain their money and power. Ostrinski describes the working class as slaves who are unaware of their situation. Only by acknowledging their place in society and the evils inflicted by the capitalist class will the workers be able to fight back. However, the workers become so fatigued by their jobs and lifestyle that they do not pay much attention to their oppression."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jungle/quotes/theme/suffering","quote":"But it is not likely that he had reference to the kind of anguish that comes with destitution, that ","desc":"The narrator, quoting a poet lamenting of anguish and despair, doubts that someone who has time to write poetry has ever experienced the sort of suffering that Jurgis and his family do on a daily basis. In fact, this statement infers that no one who has not lived in poverty can understand true anguish. The description of the family’s extreme suffering serves as part of the text’s argument for the evils of capitalism and the benefits of socialism."},{"page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jungle/quotes/theme/suffering","quote":"This was in truth not living; it was scarcely even existing, and they felt that it was too little fo","desc":"As the family experiences their first winter in Chicago, the narrator tells of their financial burdens, saying that as soon as they took care of one hardship, they would immediately face another, offering them no respite from stress and anguish.

In fact, Jurgis had never even seen a city before coming to Chicago.
