The tone of Harker’s journal changes with amazing rapidity as his stay in Castle Dracula progresses. In the course of a single chapter, Harker feels stripped of the robes of honored houseguest and considers himself bound like a prisoner. Here, Stoker demonstrates his mastery of the conventions of the Gothic novel: evoking the ruined castle, the beautiful but overpowering landscape, and the mounting sense of dread. Though Stoker did not invent Dracula or vampire lore, he did more to solidify it in the imaginations of English-speaking audiences than any author has since. Passages such as this description have spawned countless imitators, and scores of horror films owe a debt to the simple but powerful repetition of Stoker’s “doors, doors, doors everywhere.”","page":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/dracula/quotes/"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/6!/4/44[page_036]/6,/1:0,/1:100)","quote":"I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes.

In this passage from Chapter III, three beautiful vampires visit the Englishman and come dangerously close to draining him of his blood before Dracula halts them, claiming that Harker belongs to him. This passage establishes the vital link between vampirism and sex that pervades the novel. These undead women are unlike any of the living women in the novel. Whereas Mina and Lucy are models of virtue and purity, these “weird sisters” are voluptuous, aggressive, and insatiable. The position that the vampire assumes over Harker’s body suggests a sexual act, and this display of female sexual aggression both attracts and repulses Harker. In a Victorian society that prizes and rewards female virginity and domesticity, the sexually adventurous vixen is bound to be the subject of fantasy. But because of these same rigid strictures of acceptable social behavior, she is also bound to be considered dangerous. Here, Stoker takes the fantasy of the dangerous whore to its most extreme manifestation, suggesting that Harker stands to lose not simply his reputation, but also his life.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/dracula/quotes/page/2"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/24!/4/40/4[page_299],/1:490,/1:590)","quote":"Thus are we ministers of God’s own wish: that the world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be g","desc":"Here, in Chapter XXIV, Van Helsing summarizes the nature of their quest to Mina as they chase Dracula across Europe. To modern readers, the professor’s words sound like an exercise in hyperbole, as he draws very bold lines between good and evil. However, Stoker does, in fact, intend Dracula to be as much a cautionary moral tale as a novel of horror and suspense. Deeply informed by the anxieties of the Victorian age—the threat that scientific advancement posed to centuries of religious tradition, and the threat that broadening liberties for women posed to patriarchal society—Dracula makes bold distinctions between the socially acceptable and the socially unacceptable; between right and wrong; between holy and unholy. Here, as Van Helsing likens his mission to one of “the old knights of the Cross,” we should understand him not as a bombastic windbag, but as a product of genuine Victorian fear and righteousness.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/dracula/quotes/page/5"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/110/2[page_019],/3:46,/3:146)","quote":"But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not—and to know not is to care not for.","desc":"After Harker compliments Count Dracula on his impeccable English, the Count responds by claiming that although he mastered the technicalities of the language, he cannot truly speak English as a native speaker does.

However, he gave his blood willingly to help Lucy out of love, while Count Dracula forcibly took Mina’s blood for himself.
