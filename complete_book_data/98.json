This episode opens the novel’s examination of Paris and acts as a potent depiction of the peasants’ hunger. These oppressed individuals are not only physically starved—and thus willing to slurp wine from the city streets—but are also hungry for a new world order, for justice and freedom from misery. In this passage, Dickens foreshadows the lengths to which the peasants’ desperation will take them. This scene is echoed later in the novel when the revolutionaries—now similarly smeared with red, but the red of blood—gather around the grindstone to sharpen their weapons. The emphasis here on the idea of staining, as well as the scrawling of the word blood, furthers this connection, as does the appearance of the wood-sawyer, who later scares Lucie with his mock guillotine in Book the Third, Chapter 5. Additionally, the image of the wine lapping against naked feet anticipates the final showdown between Miss Pross and Madame Defarge in Book the Third, Chapter 14: “The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining of blood, those feet had come to meet that water.”","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/a-tale-of-two-cities/quotes/page/3"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/34!/4/98,/1:239,/1:339)","quote":"I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be ","desc":"Though much debate has arisen regarding the value and meaning of Sydney Carton’s sacrifice at the end of the novel, the surest key to interpretation rests in the thoughts contained in this passage, which the narrator attributes to Carton as he awaits his sacrificial death. This passage, which occurs in the final chapter, prophesies two resurrections: one personal, the other national. In a novel that seeks to examine the nature of revolution—the overturning of one way of life for another—the struggles of France and of Sydney Carton mirror each other. Here, Dickens articulates the outcome of those struggles: just as Paris will “ris[e] from [the] abyss” of the French Revolution’s chaotic and bloody violence, so too will Carton be reborn into glory after a virtually wasted life. In the prophecy that Paris will become “a beautiful city” and that Carton’s name will be “made illustrious,” the reader sees evidence of Dickens’s faith in the essential goodness of humankind. The very last thoughts attributed to Carton, in their poetic use of repetition, register this faith as a calm and soothing certainty.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/a-tale-of-two-cities/quotes/page/5"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/54,/1:182,/1:282)","quote":"In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fish","desc":"From the very beginning of the novel, the narrator makes clear that the storm of a revolution is brewing.

Madame Defarge is confident that it is well on its way, comparing the anger of the oppressed people to how the energy of lightning gathers or how an earthquake prepares itself to destroy land.

Without knowing the cause of Manette’s distress, Mr. Lorry recognizes that he is acting similarly to when Mr. Lorry and Lucie first found him in Defarge’s attic.
