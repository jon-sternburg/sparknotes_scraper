Mortimer reads the manuscript in a folk tale style, suggesting the importance of supernatural and fantasy in adding suspense to the plot.Throughout the novel, Doyle is careful to distance his legendary detective from any implication of inaccuracy, even going so far as to couch the gathering of clues in a Watson-only space up in Devonshire. Here, the mystery that serves so important a function in the novel appears third-hand, and in a manuscript read by Mortimer. The reading of the manuscript serves both to allow the detective some critical distance and to make the mystery that much more ominous.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hound/quotes/page/2"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/26!/4/2[pgepubid00011]/4[chap09]/252,/1:60,/1:160)","quote":"Over the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was thrust out an evil yellow face,","desc":"Physiognomy has a long and illustrious history, from Chaucer's gummy-toothed travelers up through the early twentieth century.

Oscar Wilde and Arthur Conan Doyle received commissions from the same publisher on the same night in 1889, Wilde for Dorian and Doyle for The Sign of Four. Doyle's physiognomy is also expressive of a classist sentiment, whereby the uneducated, ignoble criminal looks \"like a crafty and savage animal\" while the evil nobleman looks just like everybody else.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hound/quotes/page/3"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/32!/4/2[pgepubid00014]/4[chap12]/88,/1:0,/1:100)","quote":"All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist.","desc":"The criminal breaks the physiognomy mold, because his physical features do not match his personality or his behavior.

Although Doyle openly expressed his distaste for mystery stories that \"fake it,\" or do not give their readers all they need to know, Doyle springs the identity of the killer on us with very little fanfare. Like Watson, we are dumbfounded by Holmes' announcement that Stapleton and his sister are married, that Stapleton is in fact a Baskerville. Though Watson is ready to take Holmes' word for it, we are not as convinced.
