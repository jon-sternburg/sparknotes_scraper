The word the Transgressor has spoken is “I,” a concept forbidden in the society because everyone must work for the good of his or her brothers and any thought that occurs in private is necessarily evil. The Transgressor does not believe in collectivism, and he finds Equality 7-2521 in the crowd and locks eyes with him while he dies, a moment that Equality 7-2521 concludes marks him and destines him to start a new race of men who are individuals. It is the same kind of stoicism that Equality 7-2521 himself demonstrates when he is incarcerated and beaten at the Palace of Corrective Detention for refusing to tell the council about his tunnel when he returns late to the Home of the Street Sweepers. Equality 7-2521’s observation about the peaceful and even euphoric nature of the Transgressor of the Unspoken Word’s death relates closely to Rand’s belief that humans do not feel bodily pain when they suffer for the sake of an ideal. Rand’s heroes do not feel fear or remorse about their social sins when they are committed in the name of a higher good, namely, the individual. Indeed, for Rand, any action grounded in the individual’s sense of self is admirable. The Transgressor is the only character in Anthem, other than Equality 7-2521 and the Golden One, who demonstrates a sense of self-worth and a willingness to suffer for his autonomy and who thus rises above the constraints of his society.","page":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/anthem/quotes/"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/28!/4/2[pgepubid00012]/42,/1:0,/1:100)","quote":"But I still wonder how it was possible, in those graceless years of transition, long ago, that men d","desc":"Part of the exposition of Equality 7-2521’s newfound philosophy in Chapter XII, these words describe his reflection on the history of the human race and on how it came to disintegrate into madness and fear through the evils of collectivism. Anthem is, above all else, a political work, aimed at reforming those who have fallen to what Rand believes is the collectivist heresy, and at giving comfort to those who are still fighting for individualism. Rand believes that individualism will never actually perish because it is ingrained in human existence; it is the root of man’s happiness. Nevertheless, she thinks, it is possible for man to lose sight of the importance of the ego and allow society to become oppressive. Anthem is a wake-up call to those who may be losing sight, and the “graceless years of transition” are supposed to be the years of its publication, when Rand sees communism as taking hold not only in Russia but in the United States as well.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/anthem/quotes/page/5"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/6!/4/2[pgepubid00001]/14,/1:1,/1:101)","quote":"There is evil in your bones, Equality 7-2521, for your body has grown beyond the bodies of your brot","desc":"At the beginning of the novella, Equality 7-2521 tells readers that the Teachers and Leaders of the collective often tell him that “there is evil” in his bones simply because he is growing taller than his peers.
