She explains to him the reason behind her initial decision, eight years ago, to break their engagement. The various uses of persuasion is one of the main themes of the novel, but in this passage Anne rationally justifies its use. She concludes that it was correct of her to yield to persuasion by Lady Russell because she had a duty to her rank and to \"safety.\" What is notable about this passage is the cool rationality which Anne employs.
