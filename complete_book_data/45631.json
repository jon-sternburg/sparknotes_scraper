Throughout the book, Northup has endeavored to report on his experiences through an objective lens. But considering the events of the narrative, it is not surprising that Northup expresses such anger at crucial moments. The scene described is indeed ironic since the Capitol is a potent symbol of the ideals of the nation, including freedom and liberty. Being led illegally chained through the streets of such a place spurs a special bitterness that bursts through Northup’s usual journalistic tone. Speaking with emotion, seemingly because he cannot help it, Northup points out the obvious hypocrisy of the United States of his time for all to see. With the institution of slavery thriving, the nation still flaunts its belief in liberty and justice for all. Solomon’s personal experiences are rarely framed in their wider context. But here Northup, the author and narrator, cannot help but express his disgust at a national character so rife with inconsistency and complicity.","page":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/twelve-years-a-slave/quotes/"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/14!/4/30,/1:135,/1:235)","quote":"Daily witnesses of human suffering—listening to the agonizing screeches of the slave—beholding him w","desc":"In Chapter 14, Solomon Northup takes a rare moment to offer his own ideas on the origin and perpetuation of slavery. Here Solomon speaks from a conceptual distance and in essence states that many slavers themselves are not directly to blame for their inherited cruelty. He posits that the Southerners are desensitized to the daily violence they witness against enslaved people. In Solomon’s opinion this system has resulted in a culture where human life is often destroyed and brutalized. It is interesting to note that at this conceptual distance, Northup does not directly blame his cruel masters for their actions. This is not meant to forgive these characters of wrongdoing. But Northup must comment on what he himself witnessed, and that includes summations such as those shown in this quotation. Over twelve years, Solomon has had plenty of time to observe and witness the brutality of his masters and consider its origins thoroughly.","page":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/twelve-years-a-slave/quotes/"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/18!/4/24,/3:612,/3:712)","quote":"The all-glorious hope, upon which I had laid such eager hold, was crumbling to ashes in my hands.

When Solomon faces yet another bitter failure among his many attempts at securing freedom over twelve years, he worries that he will never again be free in his life. It is interesting that Solomon here does not contemplate his eventual death as a slave but rather his “sinking down” into the “bitter waters of Slavery.” Northup may here be expressing the deepest despair he felt in all his twelve years of enslavement and hinting that he would no longer try to reach his friends if this chance were missed. Combined with the heartbreaking end of Patsey’s spiritual resistance, Northup takes his readers down the darkest path he can to show the human suffering caused by the evil institution of slavery, not just in himself, but in others.","page":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/twelve-years-a-slave/quotes/"}]
