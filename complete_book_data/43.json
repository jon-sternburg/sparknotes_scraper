The letter allows us finally to glimpse the events of the novel from the inside. In this passage, Jekyll discusses the years leading up to his discovery of the potion that transforms him into Hyde. He summarizes his theory of humanity’s dual nature, which states that human beings are half virtuous and half criminal, half moral and half amoral. Jekyll’s goal in his experiments is to separate these two elements, creating a being of pure good and a being of pure evil. In this way he seeks to free his good side from dark urges while liberating his wicked side from the pangs of conscience. Ultimately, however, Jekyll succeeds only in separating out Hyde, his evil half, while he himself remains a mix of good and evil. And eventually, of course, Hyde begins to predominate, until Jekyll ceases to exist and only Hyde remains. This outcome suggests a possible fallacy in Jekyll’s original assumptions. Perhaps he did not possess an equally balanced good half and evil half, as he thought. The events of the novel imply that the dark side (Hyde) is far stronger than the rest of Jekyll—so strong that, once sent free, this side takes him over completely.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/quotes/page/4"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/6!/4/44[chap10]/4,/1:1943,/1:2043)","quote":"With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew ","desc":"Throughout Jekyll’s final letter, we see an important theme in the story: Human nature is made up of a series of oppositions—good and evil, moral and intellectual, and rational and irrational. Jekyll tries to bring moral conscience and rational analysis to investigate the central question which drove his experiment. The truth that he finds fragments his soul. Victorian society strove to separate the good from the evil in human nature to purify it. Jekyll sought to unify his soul as a natural, wholesome quest.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/quotes/theme/duality"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/6!/4/40[chap09]/62,/1:0,/1:100)","quote":"“It is well,” replied my visitor. “Lanyon, you remember your vows: what follows is under the seal of","desc":"In Dr. Lanyon’s last letter, he recounts Jekyll’s words to him before Jekyll reveals himself as Hyde.
