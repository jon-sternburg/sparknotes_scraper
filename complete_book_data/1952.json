The powerful, authoritative voices of her husband, her family, and the medical establishment urge her to be passive. Her own conviction, however, is that what she needs is precisely the opposite—activity and stimulation. From the outset, her opinions carry little weight. “Personally,” she disagrees with her treatment, but she has no power to change the situation. Gilman also begins to characterize the narrator here. The confusion over “phosphates or phosphites” is in character for someone who is not particularly interested in factual accuracy. And the choppy rhythm of the sentences, often broken into one-line paragraphs, helps evoke the hurried writing of the narrator in her secret journal, as well as the agitated state of her mind.","page":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/4/40,/1:0,/1:100)","quote":"I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus—but Jo","desc":"This section appears near the beginning of the story, and it helps characterize both the narrator’s dilemma and the narrator herself. Notably, the narrator interrupts her own train of thought by recalling John’s instructions. Gilman shows how the narrator has internalized her husband’s authority to the point that she practically hears his voice in her head, telling her what to think. Even so, she cannot help but feel the way she does, and so the move she makes at the end—focusing on the house instead of her situation—marks the beginning of her slide into obsession and madness. This mental struggle, this desperate attempt not to think about her unhappiness, makes her project her feelings onto her surroundings, especially the wallpaper, which becomes a symbolic image of “her condition.” The play on words here is typical of Gilman’s consistent use of irony throughout the story. She feels bad whenever she thinks about her “condition,” that is, about both her depression and her condition in general within her oppressive marriage.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/page/2"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/4/340,/1:0,/1:54)","quote":"Life is very much more exciting now than it used to be","desc":"This comment comes just after the scene in which the narrator catches Jennie touching the paper and resolves that no one else is allowed to figure out the pattern. It captures one of the most distinctive qualities of “The Yellow Wallpaper”: Gilman’s bitter, sarcastic sense of humor. Now that the narrator has become hopelessly obsessed with the pattern, spending all day and all night thinking about it, life has become more interesting and she is no longer bored. Gilman manages to combine humor and dread in such moments. The comment is funny, but the reader knows that someone who would make such a joke is not well. Indeed, in the section that follows, the narrator casually mentions that she considered burning the house down in order to eliminate the smell of the wallpaper.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/page/4"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/4/128,/1:244,/1:344)","quote":"John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least.

But he sees the combination of her imagination and her nerves as being detrimental to her health. He wants her to repress the imagination in order to protect the nerves. Unfortunately, while he discourages her from writing her fanciful ideas or even expressing them aloud, no one can prevent her imagination from working. At the same time, because she doesn’t dare to share what she imagines, no one can help her prevent her fancies from becoming obsessions or delusions.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/theme/repression"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/4/230,/1:63,/1:163)","quote":"I tried to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell him how I wish he wo","desc":"The narrator understands that, to John, her crying while trying to convince him to let her go visiting shows her weakness and her unfitness to travel. However, the reader understands that her crying reveals her desperation for some change to how she is currently being treated for her illness. She speaks of these relatives as people with whom she talks about her work, so her desire to see them clearly relates to her need for a creative/professional life. John believes that her writing makes her worse, not better, so he shuts down the idea of such a trip.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/theme/repression"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/4/290,/1:24,/1:124)","quote":"I beg of you, for my sake and for our child’s sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for","desc":"John attempts to shuts down his wife’s idea that while physically she may be getting better, mentally she is not. He does not want to hear this talk of her not making progress. Although he minimizes her illness, he reacts with alarm. He realizes that someone with a vivid imagination, like his wife, can will herself into illness. He orders her to repress her imagination. John brings their baby into the discussion, from whom his wife feels detached. Meanwhile, he denies her anything else to think about or do. Ironically, the narrator must find a way to get better while the tools she needs to mentally heal are taken from her.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/theme/repression"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/4/84,/1:0,/1:77)","quote":"There comes John, and I must put this away,—he hates to have me write a word.","desc":"The narrator expresses how she feels when she sees John approach and she must put away her writing. Readers understand that she has been writing this text against the direct orders of John, her husband and doctor, who believes writing weakens her health. Despite respecting her husband’s opinion and skill in general, in her own case she feels she knows better—that writing heals her. Or perhaps she does not know for sure that writing helps, but she cannot help herself. She simply is a writer and therefore must write. When John says he hates for her to write, he says indirectly that he hates for her to be herself.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/theme/selfexpression"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/4/130,/1:0,/1:100)","quote":"I think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it would relieve the press of id","desc":"The narrator’s mental health is declining. John, her husband and doctor, forbids her to write under the impression that writing exacerbates her mental instability, but she continues to surreptitiously document her thoughts. In fact, she produces this account, explaining all she goes through during her illness. Now, she attributes her intensifying depression to her lack of energy to write at all. Meanwhile, her thoughts and ideas continue to press in unabated, but she has no healthy way of contending with them anymore. The narrator reaches a point at which only a radical change in treatment will bring her back from mental collapse.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/theme/selfexpression"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/4/340,/1:56,/1:156)","quote":"You see I have something more to expect, to look forward to, to watch.

Her brain, deprived of real work, devises this project for itself. Because of her new interest, the narrator now appears physically healthier, as she eats and behaves better. But of course, the obsession shows the dramatic progression of her mental illness. She lies awake at night, indicating clinical depression, and she no longer recognizes her suspicions of the wallpaper as irrational, but instead as a mystery she must solve.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/theme/purpose"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/4/40,/1:0,/1:100)","quote":"I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus—but Jo","desc":"Although the narrator pinpoints what she truly needs to cure her depression, she acknowledges that thinking about the problem does make her feel bad.

However, John does not acknowledge these signs of illness, and thus, to a certain extent, she questions the fact herself. She does not have the medical knowledge to argue against her husband’s diagnosis that her illness is self-inflicted. She understands she feels worse but must hide her true condition, since her worsening symptoms indicate her failure to follow his prescriptions.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/character/narrator"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/4/342,/1:0,/1:100)","quote":"John is so pleased to see me improve!

She understands that her obsession with the wallpaper would be recognized as irrational by others, but nevertheless she believes that she needs to stay in the house because of the wallpaper.

Instead of wanting to leave the house, which she earlier begged to do, she fears being forced to leave.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/character/narrator"},{"cfi":"epubcfi(/6/4!/4/4/406,/1:0,/1:100)","quote":"I see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a carriage comes she hides und","desc":"The narrator describes what she believes she sees: The woman from inside the wallpaper creeping about outside. By day, the woman creeps outside, by night, she returns to the wallpaper.

However, this devotion appears to stop when it comes to his wife’s true needs. As he doesn’t believe in her illness, he sees nothing wrong with being absent all of the time.

He wants her to use her will to protect her mind by avoiding irrational thoughts. But he also calls on her to get well for his sake.

John’s response shows that he only judges her health from external markers. He deems all of the narrator’s requests—to write, to see friends, and, most of all, to get out of the room with the yellow wallpaper—unimportant or even counterproductive.

As she reflects on Jennie’s good housekeeping skills and her contentment with the work, the narrator concludes she shouldn’t expect Jennie to approve of her preference for writing. She feels amused that Jennie thinks writing makes her sick.

Jennie responds with sympathetic good humor to the narrator’s lighthearted excuse that the wallpaper is ugly and offers to finish the job. The delusional narrator does not believe Jennie’s sincerity.

By now, she believes that the wallpaper intentionally trapped a woman inside itself, whom she must free. In her paranoia she assumes Jennie knows about the woman also.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/quotes/character/jennie"}]
