[{"quote":"Pangloss gave instruction in metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology. He proved admirably that there cannot possibly be an effect without a cause and that in this best of all possible worlds the baron’s castle was the most beautiful of all castles and his wife the best of all possible baronesses. —It is clear, said he, that things cannot be otherwise than they are, for since everything is made to serve an end, everything necessarily serves the best end. Observe: noses were made to support spectacles, hence we have spectacles. Legs, as anyone can plainly see, were made to be breeched, and so we have breeches... Consequently, those who say everything is well are uttering mere stupidities; they should say everything is for the best","desc":"This explanation of Pangloss’s optimistic philosophy is quoted from Chapter 1. His philosophy is both the most important point for debate among the novel’s characters and one of the main targets of Voltaire’s satirical jabs. Pangloss’s—and his student Candide’s—indomitable belief that human beings live in “the best of all possible worlds” comes under brutal attack by the horrific events that they live through. Their belief broadly resembles the conclusions of a number of the most influential philosophers of Voltaire’s time. In particular, the philosopher Leibniz famously maintains that, since the world was created by God, and since the mind of God is the most benevolent and capable mind imaginable, the world must be the best world imaginable. Under such a system, humans perceive evil only because they do not understand the force governing the world and thus do not know that every ill exists only for a greater good. Candide is widely thought to be Voltaire’s sarcastic retort to Leibniz. In this quotation, Voltaire attacks not only philosophical optimism but also the foibles and errors of Enlightenment philosophy. Enlightenment philosophers such as Leibniz focused a great deal of attention on the interplay of cause and effect. Pangloss’s argument about spectacles and breeches demonstrates a ridiculous inability to properly distinguish between cause and effect. Spectacles fit noses not because God created noses to fit spectacles, as Pangloss claims, but the other way around. The obviousness of this point is meant to echo the obviousness of the flaws Voltaire observes in the Enlightenment philosophical process.","page":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/"},{"quote":"—A hundred times I wanted to kill myself, but always I loved life more. This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our worst instincts; is anything more stupid than choosing to carry a burden that really one wants to cast on the ground? to hold existence in horror, and yet to cling to it? to fondle the serpent which devours us till it has eaten out our heart? —In the countries through which I have been forced to wander, in the taverns where I have had to work, I have seen a vast number of people who hated their existence; but I never saw more than a dozen who deliberately put an end to their own misery.","desc":"The old woman, after telling of the rape, slavery, and cannibalism she has experienced, launches into this speculation about suicide in Chapter 12. The question of why more unfortunate people do not kill themselves seems rational in the context of the calamitous, merciless world of the novel. In Voltaire’s time, the first and easiest answer should have been that God and Christian doctrine forbid suicide and that those who kill themselves are consigned to spend eternity in hell. However, the old woman’s very existence, as an illegitimate child of a Pope, makes a statement against the church, and she does not even consider this approach to the question of suicide. Perhaps the implication is that hell cannot possibly be worse than life, or perhaps the old woman, after her experiences, does not believe in God or an afterlife. The pessimism of this passage is obvious and fairly thorough. The one glimmer of hope that shines through the old woman’s words comes from her assertion that people cling to life because they “love” it, not because they are resigned or because they fear eternal punishment. The serpent that is life is not just tolerated but “fondle[d].” Human beings, then, naturally embrace life—a “stupid” move, perhaps, but one that demonstrates passion, strong will, and an almost heroic endurance.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/page/2"},{"quote":"The enormous riches which this rascal had stolen were sunk beside him in the sea, and nothing was saved but a single sheep. —You see, said Candide to Martin, crime is punished sometimes; this scoundrel of a Dutch merchant has met the fate he deserved. —Yes, said Martin; but did the passengers aboard his ship have to perish too? God punished the scoundrel, the devil drowned the others.","desc":"In Chapter 20, Candide and Martin engage in this debate over the sinking of Vanderdendur’s ship. Candide, who tries throughout the novel to find support for Pangloss’s optimistic faith in the workings of the world, sees Vanderdendur’s fate as a sign that justice is sometimes served by disasters such as shipwrecks, and thus that these disasters serve a higher purpose. Martin, the consummate pessimist, points out quite reasonably that there is no just reason why the other people on Vanderdendur’s ship had to die along with him. Martin interprets the event as the product of both God’s justice and the devil’s cruel mischief. Implied in this statement is the pessimistic idea that the devil’s hand is just as evident in the world as God’s, and the subversive idea that God and the devil inadvertently cooperate in determining the course of human affairs.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/page/3"},{"quote":". . . [W]hen they were not arguing, the boredom was so fierce that one day the old woman ventured to say: —I should like to know which is worse, being raped a hundred times by negro pirates, having a buttock cut off, running the gauntlet in the Bulgar army, being flogged and hanged in an auto-da-fé, being dissected and rowing in the galleys—experiencing, in a word, all the miseries through which we have passed—or else just sitting here and doing nothing? —It’s a hard question, said Candide. These words gave rise to new reflections, and Martin in particular concluded that man was bound to live either in convulsions of misery or in the lethargy of boredom.","desc":"By Chapter 30, Candide and his friends have money, peace, and security, and Candide has finally married Cunégonde. But, as the old woman points out, these rare blessings have not brought them happiness. This passage implies that human beings do not suffer only as a result of political oppression, violent crime, war, or natural disaster. They suffer also from their own intrinsic flaws of chronic bad-temperedness and restlessness. Up to this point, all of the characters have been marvelously adept at getting themselves out of difficult or miserable situations. Faced with boredom in the absence of suffering, however, they cannot seem to find any way out on their own, and turn to “a very famous dervish” for advice. The one site of unmixed goodness and joy presented in the novel is the paradise of Eldorado, which Candide and Cacambo choose to leave. At the time, their decision to venture back into the world seems unwise. By this point in the novel, however, the reader wonders in retrospect whether the plague of boredom would not eventually have afflicted them in Eldorado as severely as it does in Constantinople. The boredom, as Martin’s words emphasize, seems to result not from an absence of happiness but an absence of suffering.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/page/4"},{"quote":"—You are perfectly right, said Pangloss; for when man was put into the garden of Eden, he was put there ut operaretur eum, so that he should work it; this proves that man was not born to take his ease. —Let’s work without speculating, said Martin; it’s the only way of rendering life bearable. The whole little group entered into this laudable scheme; each one began to exercise his talents. The little plot yielded fine crops . . . and Pangloss sometimes used to say to Candide: —All events are linked together in the best of possible worlds; for, after all, if you had not been driven from a fine castle by being kicked in the backside for love of Miss Cunégonde, if you hadn’t been sent before the Inquisition, if you hadn’t traveled across America on foot, if you hadn’t given a good sword thrust to the baron, if you hadn’t lost all your sheep from the good land of Eldorado, you wouldn’t be sitting here eating candied citron and pistachios. —That is very well put, said Candide, but we must go and work our garden.","desc":"This is the final passage of the novel. The cure for the crushing boredom described in the previous quotation has been found in the hard work of gardening. As Pangloss points out, this cure recalls the state of mankind in the garden of Eden, where man was master of all things. On their small plot of land in Turkey, these characters seem to have a control over their destinies that they could not achieve in their lives up until this point. Instead of living at the mercy of circumstances, they are—literally—reaping what they sow. It is, of course, surprising that this fictional argument against optimism should be presented as a happy ending. Given this ending, the reader might for the first time be inclined to wonder whether Pangloss is right in claiming to live in “the best of possible worlds.” But that claim and all arguments against it are proscribed by the lifestyle the characters have discovered. As Candide implies in his final line, gardening leaves no time for philosophical speculation, and everyone is happier and more productive as a result.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/page/5"},{"quote":"At the court-martial, he was asked which he preferred: to be flogged thirty-six times by the whole regiment, or to have his brains blown out with a dozen musket balls.","desc":"After being forced into the Bulgarian army, Candide wanders away for a walk one day and is arrested for desertion. The narrator describes his choice of punishment: He must choose to be either flogged or shot. Candide tries to decline both, but he must choose, so he opts for the flogging. Candide discovers that the regimen contains 2,000 men and he is bludgeoned nearly to death, reinforcing the theme of the absurdity of free will in choosing between two horrible choices.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/theme/absurdity"},{"quote":"“All of this was indispensably necessary,” replied the one-eyed doctor; “for private misfortunes are public benefits; so that the more private misfortunes there are the greater is the general good.”","desc":"After the Anabaptist James disagrees with Pangloss’s philosophy that things cannot possibly be better, Pangloss defends himself with this convoluted reply.

Here, Candide describes a scene during which the orator’s wife makes her opinions known.

With so much abundance of wealth in the kingdom, people do not petition God, only thank him. The reverend sage goes on to say that clergy do not exist. Instead, all people serve as priests in daily unified thanksgiving. Candide reacts with wonder at the absence of power struggles and inquisitions to enforce doctrinal compliance.

His masters chopped off one of his hands and one of his legs, and as such, he complains about his wretched life. He questions his treatment as a contradiction between the truism that all people descend from one father and society’s treatment of blacks differently from whites.

Children play games with precious jewels found like common pebbles in the street and people use gold and silver as common home construction materials.

Here, Pangloss, ever the optimist, tries to comfort them with his consistent philosophy that everything is for the best. Pangloss’s optimism relies on the logical fallacy of circular reasoning: The same proposition occurs as both a premise— the volcano in Lisbon could be in no other place but Lisbon—and a conclusion—Lisbon is the best possible spot for the volcano.

Readers learn that Pangloss didn’t die while hanging, and he woke up when a surgeon tried to dissect what he believed to be a corpse.

After all of the novel’s criticism of religions of all kinds, readers may note the irony in Pangloss’s biblical allusion. By definition, the Garden of Eden conveys a paradise free from toil.

As Candide prepares to sail for Bordeaux, he offers to pay passage and a wage to whomever he chooses. He assembles twenty men who each tell their sad stories. In the end, Candide chooses Martin, the most miserable and honest of the twenty, to accompany him.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/martin"},{"quote":"[B]ut I must confess, when I cast my eye on this globe, or rather globule, I cannot help thinking that God has abandoned it to some evil beginning.","desc":"Martin, the pessimist to Pangloss’s optimist, discusses philosophy at length with Candide as the two sail to France. He claims to be a Manichean—a believer in two equal spirits of Good and Evil that struggle to gain control of the universe. Candide says that the devil must be in Martin and Martin agrees that the devil exists in nearly everyone.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/martin"},{"quote":"“But then why,” said Candide, “was the world formed?” “To drive us mad,” said Martin.","desc":"On board the ship bound for France, Candide asks Martin for his view on the meaning of life after Martin expresses skepticism about all scientific theories. Martin functions as a counterpoint to Pangloss, as he relentlessly expresses profound pessimism. The remark equating life with madness seems ironic as Martin appears to be the sanest character in the novel.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/martin"},{"quote":"“That is,” replied Martin, “there is a pleasure in having no pleasure.”","desc":"Martin expresses this paradox to Candide after they have toured the Venetian nobleman’s library. As they engage in a Socratic dialogue about Pococuranté’s criticism of the masterpieces he owns, Candide postulates that such superiority indicates a contented mind. Martin counters with Plato’s metaphor that healthy stomachs don’t refuse all food. Together, they arrive at the conclusion that their host finds a strange pleasure in his own discontent. Clearly, Martin and Candide try to make sense of contradictory ideas and observations.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/martin"},{"quote":"“Let’s work, then, without disputing,” says Martin. “It is the only way to make life bearable.”","desc":"Martin converses with Candide and the others and states what some readers consider the major theme of the novel. Despite all the fantastic events, the near-deaths, the unlikely reunions, and the litany of bawdy and gory circumstances, the story culminates to this idea: Hard work serves as the only panacea that makes life worth living.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/martin"},{"quote":"Her daughter, Cunégonde, was about seventeen years of age, fresh-coloured, comely, plump, and amiable.","desc":"The narrator introduces Cunégonde. Although she says little throughout the story, she serves as one of the major incentives that inspires Candide and moves the plot along. Later, Cunégonde’s brother the baron banishes Candide from his house for a kiss Candide and Cunégonde share. Candide’s banishment sparks the story’s narrative arc into play.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cungonde"},{"quote":"She innocently took hold of his hand, and he as innocently kissed hers with a warmth, a sensibility, a grace—all very particular: their lips met; their eyes sparkled; their knees trembled; their hands strayed.","desc":"The narrator describes the moment Candide and Cunégonde kiss. Unfortunately, Cunégonde’s brother the baron passes by and witnesses the tender moment. In response, the baron kicks Candide in the rear and drives him from the castle, an event that initiates the odyssey narrated in the book. Readers may note the clipped clauses in this quote. Such a staccato-like writing style satirizes the romantic romps of the time by packing a sexual encounter into one sentence.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cungonde"},{"quote":"“Good heavens!” cried Candide, “is it you? Is it Miss Cunégonde I see before me, alive? Do I find you again in Portugal? Then you have not been ravished?”","desc":"Candide can hardly believe his eyes when the old woman brings out the long-lost Cunégonde. Candide believed Cunégonde was raped and killed, so he feels overjoyed to see her once again. Reunited, he catches up on the facts. He can see that she isn’t dead, so he asks if she was indeed raped, with the hope that she will refute that as well.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cungonde"},{"quote":"I cannot see how you could be more unfortunate than I. Add to this, though born a baroness, and bearing seventy-two quarterings, I have been reduced to a cook-wench.","desc":"Cunégonde speaks to the old woman after they escape on horseback. The two women compare their tortured pasts. Cunégonde recounts the gruesome litany of her troubles, and in response, the old woman recounts her own litany, as if competing to see who suffered a worse life. Regardless, both stories portray the absurd unpredictability of human life and the amazing scope of human cruelty.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cungonde"},{"quote":"Cacambo, who had seen many of these kinds of adventures, was not discouraged. He stripped the baron of his Jesuit’s habit and put it upon Candide.","desc":"Here, the narrator relates Cacambo’s quick thinking in tight situations. In this case, as soon as Candide murders the baron-turned-Jesuit-priest, Cacambo quickly disguises Candide and helps him escape—again. His plan works and Candide gets away, dressed as a Jesuit, which soon gets him into more trouble as the Oreillons they later meet despise Jesuits. Many times, Cacambo’s wit and wisdom save the day.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cacambo"},{"quote":"The wary Cacambo had taken care to fill his satchel with bread, chocolate, some ham, some fruit, and a few bottles of wine.","desc":"The narrator explains how not only did Candide’s servant Cacambo create a means for Candide to escape after murdering the baron and priest, he also had the foresight to bring along food and drink for them to share once they were out of harm’s way. While Candide seems to always function in the present moment, Cacambo thinks ahead. His practicality and wisdom contrasts with Candide’s impulsivity and reactiveness. Their relationship represents a classic case of the servant outwitting the master.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cacambo"},{"quote":"Do not despair. I understand a little of the jargon of these people; I will speak to them.","desc":"Here, Cacambo offers to speak to the Oreillons and, in doing so, saves his and Candide’s lives. Cacambo and Candide face being cooked and eaten by the Oreillons, just after Candide killed the monkey lovers of the two naked women in the woods. The angry women gave Candide and Cacambo up to the Oreillons who captured the pair as they slept. After Cacambo explains the situation, the Oreillons not only let him and Candide go, they treat them well.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cacambo"},{"quote":"If we do not meet with agreeable things, we shall at least meet with something new.","desc":"Cacambo and Candide begin their harrowing expedition to El Dorado. They find an empty canoe by the side of a river and, here, Cacambo encourages Candide his master to embark on a journey to the unknown. This moment and these words mark the beginning of a switch in their relationship: Cacambo transitions into the master while Candide plays the secondary role.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cacambo"},{"quote":"“All we ask of your majesty” said Cacambo “is only a few sheep laden with provisions, pebbles and the clay of your country.”","desc":"Cacambo’s request of El Dorado’s king for bounty reflects his brilliance in diplomacy. He characterizes the gold as clay and the precious jewels as pebbles, the kingdom’s common natural resources. The king, who favors Candide and Cacambo, willingly grants the request because the gold and jewels have little value to him due to their abundance. Cacambo and Candide intend to return to Europe as rich men, but of course, fate would have other plans for them.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cacambo"},{"quote":"He was in despair at the thought of parting with so good a master, who treated him more like an intimate friend than a servant; but the pleasure of being able to do him a service soon got the better of his sorrow.","desc":"The narrator explains Cacambo’s reluctance to head to Buenos Aryes to fetch Cunégonde in exchange for treasure, while Candide stays behind. Through the relationship between Candide and Cacambo, readers explore the theme of exploitation of servants. Candide and Cacambo have switched roles several times throughout the story, and they view each other as equals. The narrator cues the reader that Cacambo’s self-interest wins out, the lure of treasure overcoming any hesitation to leave his friend.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cacambo"},{"quote":"I cannot at present say anything more to you. I am a slave, and my master waits for me: I must go and wait on him at table. But mum! Say not a word; only get your supper and be ready.","desc":"Here, Cacambo, a character readers believed to be dead, reappears and speaks to Candide and Martin who dine with some strangers in Venice. Cacambo tells Candide that Cunégonde lives in Constantinople. In a deus ex machina plot turn, despite being a slave, he then arranges a ship to go there.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cacambo"},{"quote":"Cacambo, who worked in the garden, and carried the produce of it to sell at Constantinople, was worn down by this labor and cursed his fate.","desc":"The narrator reveals how Cacambo ends up discontented with what turns out to be a normal, prosperous lifestyle. This detail appears in an epilogue that characterizes the cohort’s boredom with a life lacking adventure. Readers might especially sympathize with the clever Cacambo deprived of the stage for his stratagems. All of the novel’s major characters end up cultivating their garden as the story ends on a happy, uplifting note.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/candide/quotes/character/cacambo"}]
