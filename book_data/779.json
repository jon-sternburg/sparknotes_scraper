[{"quote":"The reward of sin is death? That’s hard. Si peccasse negamus, fallimur, et nulla est in nobis veritas. If we say that we have no sin, We deceive ourselves, and there’s no truth in us. Why then belike we must sin, And so consequently die. Ay, we must die an everlasting death. What doctrine call you this? Che sarà, sarà: What will be, shall be! Divinity, adieu! These metaphysics of magicians, And necromantic books are heavenly! (1.40–50)","desc":"Faustus speaks these lines near the end of his opening soliloquy. In this speech, he considers various fields of study one by one, beginning with logic and proceeding through medicine and law. Seeking the highest form of knowledge, he arrives at theology and opens the Bible to the New Testament, where he quotes from Romans and the first book of John. He reads that “[t]he reward of sin is death,” and that “[i]f we say we that we have no sin, / We deceive ourselves, and there’s no truth in us.” The logic of these quotations—everyone sins, and sin leads to death—makes it seem as though Christianity can promise only death, which leads Faustus to give in to the fatalistic “What will be, shall be! Divinity, adieu!” However, Faustus neglects to read the very next line in John, which states, “If we confess our sins, [God] is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9). By ignoring this passage, Faustus ignores the possibility of redemption, just as he ignores it throughout the play. Faustus has blind spots; he sees what he wants to see rather than what is really there. This blindness is apparent in the very next line of his speech: having turned his back on heaven, he pretends that “[t]hese metaphysics of magicians, / And necromantic books are heavenly.” He thus inverts the cosmos, making black magic “heavenly” and religion the source of “everlasting death.”","page":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/"},{"quote":"MEPHASTOPHILIS: Why this is hell, nor am I out of it. Think’st thou that I, who saw the face of God, And tasted the eternal joys of heaven, Am not tormented with ten thousand hells In being deprived of everlasting bliss? O Faustus, leave these frivolous demands, Which strike a terror to my fainting soul. FAUSTUS: What, is great Mephastophilis so passionate For being deprivèd of the joys of heaven? Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude, And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess. (3.76–86)","desc":"This exchange shows Faustus at his most willfully blind, as he listens to Mephastophilis describe how awful hell is for him even as a devil, and as he then proceeds to dismiss Mephastophilis’s words blithely, urging him to have “manly fortitude.” But the dialogue also shows Mephastophilis in a peculiar light. We know that he is committed to Faustus’s damnation—he has appeared to Faustus because of his hope that Faustus will renounce God and swear allegiance to Lucifer. Yet here Mephastophilis seems to be urging Faustus against selling his soul, telling him to “leave these frivolous demands, / Which strike a terror to my fainting soul.” There is a parallel between the experience of Mephastophilis and that of Faustus. Just as Faustus now is, Mephastophilis was once prideful and rebelled against God; like Faustus, he is damned forever for his sin. Perhaps because of this connection, Mephastophilis cannot accept Faustus’s cheerful dismissal of hell in the name of “manly fortitude.” He knows all too well the terrible reality, and this knowledge drives him, in spite of himself, to warn Faustus away from his t-errible course.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/page/2"},{"quote":"MEPHASTOPHILIS.: Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed In one self-place; for where we are is hell, And where hell is, there must we ever be... All places shall be hell that is not heaven. FAUSTUS: Come, I think hell’s a fable. MEPHASTOPHILISs.: Ay, think so still, till experience change thy mind... FAUSTUS: Think’st thou that Faustus is so fond to imagine That after this life there is any pain? Tush, these are trifles and mere old wives’ tales. (5.120–135)","desc":"This exchange again shows Mephastophilis warning Faustus about the horrors of hell. This time, though, their exchange is less significant for what Mephastophilis says about hell than for Faustus’s response to him. Why anyone would make a pact with the devil is one of the most vexing questions surrounding Doctor Faustus, and here we see part of Marlowe’s explanation. We are constantly given indications that Faustus doesn’t really understand what he is doing. He is a secular Renaissance man, so disdainful of traditional religion that he believes hell to be a “fable” even when he is conversing with a devil. Of course, such a belief is difficult to maintain when one is trafficking in the supernatural, but Faustus has a fallback position. Faustus takes Mephastophilis’s assertion that hell will be “[a]ll places … that is not heaven” to mean that hell will just be a continuation of life on earth. He fails to understand the difference between him and Mephastophilis: unlike Mephastophilis, who has lost heaven permanently, Faustus, despite his pact with Lucifer, is not yet damned and still has the possibility of repentance. He cannot yet understand the torture against which Mephastophilis warns him, and imagines, fatally, that he already knows the worst of what hell will be.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/page/3"},{"quote":"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss: Her lips sucks forth my soul, see where it flies! Come Helen, come, give me my soul again. Here will I dwell, for heaven be in these lips, And all is dross that is not Helena! (12.81–87)","desc":"These lines come from a speech that Faustus makes as he nears the end of his life and begins to realize the terrible nature of the bargain he has made. Despite his sense of foreboding, Faustus enjoys his powers, as the delight he takes in conjuring up Helen makes clear. While the speech marks a return to the eloquence that he shows early in the play, Faustus continues to display the same blind spots and wishful thinking that characterize his behavior throughout the drama. At the beginning of the play, he dismisses religious transcendence in favor of magic; now, after squandering his powers in petty, self-indulgent behavior, he looks for transcendence in a woman, one who may be an illusion and not even real flesh and blood. He seeks heavenly grace in Helen’s lips, which can, at best, offer only earthly pleasure. “[M]ake me immortal with a kiss,” he cries, even as he continues to keep his back turned to his only hope for escaping damnation—namely, repentance.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/page/4"},{"quote":"Ah Faustus, Now hast thou but one bare hour to live, And then thou must be damned perpetually... The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike, The devil will come, and Faustus must be damned. O I’ll leap up to my God! Who pulls me down? See, see where Christ’s blood streams in the firmament! One drop would save my soul, half a drop: ah my Christ— Ah, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ; Yet will I call on him—O spare me, Lucifer! . . . Earth, gape! O no, it will not harbor me. You stars that reigned at my nativity, Whose influence hath allotted death and hell, Now draw up Faustus like a foggy mist Into the entrails of yon laboring cloud, That when you vomit forth into the air My limbs may issue from your smoky mouths, So that my soul may but ascend to heaven... O God, if thou wilt not have mercy on my soul, . . . Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years, A hundred thousand, and at last be saved... Cursed be the parents that engendered me: No, Faustus, curse thy self, curse Lucifer, That hath deprived thee of the joys of heaven... My God, my God, look not so fierce on me! . . . Ugly hell gape not! Come not, Lucifer! I’ll burn my books—ah, Mephastophilis! (13.57–113)","desc":"These lines come from Faustus’s final speech, just before the devils take him down to hell. It is easily the most dramatic moment in the play, and Marlowe uses some of his finest rhetoric to create an unforgettable portrait of the mind of a man about to carried off to a horrific doom. Faustus goes from one idea to another, desperately seeking a way out. But no escape is available, and he ends by reaching an understanding of his own guilt: “No, Faustus, curse thy self, curse Lucifer, / That hath deprived thee of the joys of heaven.” This final speech raises the question of why Faustus does not repent earlier and, more importantly, why his desperate cries to Christ for mercy are not heard. In a truly Christian framework, Faustus would be allowed a chance at redemption even at the very end. But Marlowe’s play ultimately proves more tragic than Christian, and so there comes a point beyond which Faustus can no longer be saved. He is damned, in other words, while he is still alive.Faustus’s last line aptly expresses the play’s representation of a clash between Renaissance and medieval values. “I’ll burn my books,” Faustus cries as the devils come for him, suggesting, for the first time since scene 2, when his slide into mediocrity begins, that his pact with Lucifer is about gaining limitless knowledge, an ambition that the Renaissance spirit celebrated but that medieval Christianity denounced as an expression of sinful human pride. As he is carried off to hell, Faustus seems to give in to the Christian worldview, denouncing, in a desperate attempt to save himself, the quest for knowledge that has defined most of his life.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/page/5"},{"quote":"What, is great Mephostophilis so passionate For being deprivèd of the joys of heaven? Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess. Go bear these tidings to great Lucifer: Seeing Faustus hath incurred eternal death By desperate thoughts against Jove’s deity, Say he surrenders up to him his soul So he will spare him four and twenty years, Letting him live in all voluptuousness, Having thee ever to attend on me . . . And always be obedient to my will.","desc":"Faustus speaks to Mephostophilis in response to Mephostophilis’ warnings about falling from God and making a deal with the devil. The theme of sin versus redemption plays out through Faustus’s decision to ignore the warnings and choose sin, making a deal with Lucifer, over the joys of heaven. Faustus surrenders his good soul in order to gain the power of having Mephostophilis at his beck and call. Faustus focuses only on the power he will gain from making this deal, looking past his drastic decision to choose sin and evil over redemption and God.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/sin-versus-redemption"},{"quote":"O gentle Faustus, leave this damnèd art, This magic that will charm thy soul to hell And quite bereave thee of salvation. Though thou has now offended like a man, Do not persever in it like a devil. Yet, yet, thou hast an amiable soul If sin by custom grow not into nature. Then, Faustus, will repentance come too late! Then, thou art banished from the sight of heaven! No mortal can express the pains of hell! . . . For gentle son, I speak it not in wrath Or envy of thee but in tender love . . . And so have hope that this my kind rebuke, Checking thy body, may amend thy soul.","desc":"An old man pleads with Faustus to repent and turn away from sin and the devil. In these lines, the old man not only implores Faustus to repent before it is too late, but he also warns of the harsh pains of hell and explains how Faustus can repent and come back to God as long as he still has his good soul. While Faustus starts to contemplate redemption, Mephostophilis threatens Faustus and quickly turns him back to evil and sin.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/sin-versus-redemption"},{"quote":"But Faustus’ offense can ne’er be pardoned. The serpent that tempted Eve may be saved, but not Faustus!

Sweet friends, what shall become of Faustus being in hell forever?","desc":"Faustus speaks directly to the scholars about his decision to make a bargain with Lucifer and turn away from God, vehemently declaring that he now has moved beyond saving. Faustus accepts the consequences of his choices despite his strong feelings of regret. In these lines, Faustus wishes for redemption but accepts that his many decisions to turn toward sin have placed him in his current position, incapable of redemption.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/sin-versus-redemption"},{"quote":"What doctrine call you this?

These metaphysics of magicians And negromantic books are heavenly; Lines, circles, letters, characters— Ay these are those that Faustus most desires. O, what a world of profit and delight, Of power, of honor, and omnipotence Is promised to the studious artisan!","desc":"Here, Faustus speaks to himself while in his study as he thinks about what he hopes to learn or focus on next. In these lines, Faustus presents the theme of Medieval versus Renaissance as he dismisses religion and moves toward individualism, science, and black magic. During the time period of this play, most people possessed a Medieval focus, looking to God and religion only. However, here Faustus literally says goodbye to divinity and makes a Renaissance decision to seek learning and dark magic to further his individual power and profit.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/medieval-versus-renaissance"},{"quote":"Learnèd Faustus, To find the secrets of astronomy Graven in the book of Jove’s high firmament, Did mount him up to scale Olympus’ top: Where, sitting in a chariot burning bright Drawn by the strength of yoked dragons’ necks, He views the clouds, the planets, and the stars[.]","desc":"Here, the Chorus reveals to the audience how Faustus has spent his time since making his bargain with the devil. These lines describe Faustus’s focus on learning as he studies astronomy and other sciences. This educational tour represents Faustus’s transition from a Medieval focus on god to a Renaissance emphasis on learning and individualism. At the same time, the Chorus describes Faustus sitting in a bright chariot carried by dragons, also symbolizing the dark magic and Renaissance individualism accompanying Faustus on his quest for learning.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/medieval-versus-renaissance"},{"quote":"Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight And burnèd is Apollo’s laurel bough That someone grew within this learnèd man.

As the Chorus describes how “learnèd” Faustus fell because he looked to dark magic and evil rather than following God’s way, the theme of Medieval versus Renaissance shines through one more time. However, in this final moral lesson, the Chorus instructs the audience to be wary of the Renaissance movement, using Faustus as an example of what not to do in the search for knowledge and happiness.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/medieval-versus-renaissance"},{"quote":"Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please?

Despite the Good Angel’s attempts to persuade Faustus to look toward god and redemption, Faustus is blinded by the power, fame, and wealth that the Bad Angel reminds him he will have with Lucifer. In Faustus’s lines, he describes all the ways he can control the spirits to do what he wants, revealing his greedy and power-hungry side.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/power-and-ambition"},{"quote":"Had I as many souls as there be stars I’d give them all for Mephostophilis.

Now that I have obtained what I desired I’ll live in speculation of this art Till Mephostophilis return again.","desc":"After Faustus declares his intentions of surrendering his soul for twenty-four years of living with power, Mephostophilis agrees to take his bargain to Lucifer. In these lines, Faustus responds to Mephostophilis’ agreement by describing how much power and wealth he will gain through this deal with the devil. When Faustus lists how far he will go with Mephostophilis’ help, he demonstrates the toxic effects of power and ambition on a man because he freely gives up his good soul for his blinding greed.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/power-and-ambition"},{"quote":"Bad Angel. Gave ear to me, And now must taste hell’s pains perpetually. Good Angel. O, what will all thy riches, pleasures, Pomps Avail thee now? Bad Angel. Nothing but vex thee more, To want in hell, that had on earth such store.","desc":"Here, the Good Angel and the Bad Angel discuss the fallout from Faustus’s greedy ambition and need for power. The Good Angel pretty much calls out Faustus, asking him how his wealth and fame will help him now that he faces eternal damnation. Even the Bad Angel comments on how, in hell, Faustus will regret his choices and wish for the grace of divinity that he had and freely gave away for short-lived power and fame. In this section, the theme of power and ambition comes full circle as Faustus’s fate is realized.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/power-and-ambition"},{"quote":"To practice magic and concealèd arts. Philosophy is odious and obscure, Both law and physic are for petty wits, Divinity is basest of the three— Unpleasant, harsh, contemptible, and vile. ’Tis magic, magic, that hath ravished me!","desc":"The theme of free will versus fate presents itself as Faustus contemplates on what area of study he will focus his attention. Here, Faustus discusses his reasoning for gravitating toward magic over other subjects, such as physics and divinity. Ultimately, Faustus makes clear that he feels empowered to choose his next step in life. Therefore, in this beginning section of the play, Faustus exercises his free will as he chooses his next steps. Sadly, the choices Faustus makes will ultimately lead him to lose his free will; thus, his example serves as a cautionary tale for readers for certain.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/free-will-versus-fate"},{"quote":"I, John Faustus of Wittenberg, Doctor, by these presents, do give body and soul to Lucifer, prince of the east, and his minister Mephostophilis, and furthermore grant unto them that, four and twenty years being expired, and these articles above written being inviolate, full power to fetch or carry the said John Faustus, body and soul, flesh, blood, or goods, into their habitation wheresoever.","desc":"Despite much scrutiny, Faustus officially signs his soul over to Lucifer. Through this decision, Faustus essentially gives up his free will and places his fate in the hands of Lucifer and Mephostophilis. In this moment, Faustus goes from a character who gets to decide what he wants to do to a character who is completely dependent on Mephostophilis’ and Lucifer’s power. With these lines, the theme of free will versus fate switches sides as Faustus literally signs in blood that he gives “body and soul to Lucifer.”","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/free-will-versus-fate"},{"quote":"The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike: The devil will come, and Faustus must be damned!

Yet will I call on him! O spare me, Lucifer!","desc":"With these lines, Faustus fully realizes his fate. While he wishes he could stop time and avoid damnation, he passionately declares his acceptance of this fate. In this moment, free will is fully replaced by fate as Faustus describes how no matter what he does, time will continue, the stars will exist, and his soul will go with Lucifer. Even when Faustus yells out to Christ, he gives up his free will and succumbs to the fact that his fate rests solely in the hands of Lucifer.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/free-will-versus-fate"},{"quote":"Now that the gloomy shadow of the night, Longing to view Orion’s drizzling look, Leaps from th’ antarctic world unto the sky And dims the welkin with her pitchy breath, Faustus, begin thine incantations And try if devils will obey thy hest, Seeing thou hast prayed and sacrificed to them. Within this circle is Jehovah’s name Forward and backward anagrammatized, Th’ abbreviated names of holy saints, Figures of every adjunct to the heavens, And characters of signs and erring stars, By which the spirits are enforced to rise: Then fear not, Faustus, to be resolute And try the utmost magic can perform.","desc":"Faustus summons the powers of black magic when he calls Lucifer and the devils for the first time. While he has been contemplating trying magic, in this quote, Faustus finally takes the leap and begins to conjure evil spirits. The language in these lines identifies a change in Faustus from a man connected to divinity to an individual moving to a dark, supernatural world. This experiment with dark magic begins Faustus’s journey into the underworld, leading him directly to Mephostophilis and Lucifer.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/dark-magic"},{"quote":"Faustus, thou shalt.

So Faustus, now for all their holiness, Do what thou wilt, thou shalt not be discerned.","desc":"As Faustus plots his trickery with the Pope and cardinals, he asks Mephostophilis to make him invisible so he can fool them more easily. Here, Mephostophilis performs a magic spell to make Faustus invisible. Once again, the rhythmic, descriptive language in these lines clearly reveals the spell’s connection to magic and darkness. This scene shows how Faustus relies on Mephostophilis’ magic to achieve his mischievous and ambitious desires, which ultimately forever binds Faustus to his darkness.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/dark-magic"},{"quote":"Emperor.

These are but shadows, not substantial.","desc":"Faustus promises the Emperor that he will conjure the spirits of Great Alexander and his paramour and then orders Mephostophilis to make these events happen. While Mephostophilis’ dark magic produces the spirits, Faustus warns and reminds the Emperor that while the spirits appear real, they are only “shadows, not substantial.” The theme of dark magic intertwines through this scene as the limits of Mephostophilis’ dark powers are revealed. Even though dark magic can conjure spirits and give Faustus notoriety, such magic produces effects that lack substance and cannot be embraced. Readers might infer that such a detail implies that all dark magic promises is shallow and meaningless in the greater scheme of life.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/theme/dark-magic"},{"quote":"And now to patient judgements we appeal And speak for Faustus in his infancy.

Through these lines, the Chorus explains that while Faustus was born in Rhode to average parents and went to Wittenberg when he got older and became a doctor, he was raised to appreciate theology and divinity.

In these lines, the Chorus compares Faustus to Icarus, a figure in Greek mythology who flew too close to the sun with waxed wings despite his father’s warnings and, as a result, fell to his death. This comparison identifies Faustus as arrogantly determined to seek out dark magic despite his strong theology background and its warnings against “devilish exercise.”","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/faustus"},{"quote":"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us.

In these lines, Faustus says goodbye to divinity, identifying his doubts about living without sin only to die anyway.

In these lines, Faustus convinces himself to stop thinking about redemption because redemption is not possible.

The play uses Faustus’s character to teach a moral lesson, favoring redemption and warning against sin.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/faustus"},{"quote":"I am a servant to great Lucifer And may not follow thee without his leave. No more than he commands must we perform.","desc":"When Mephostophilis first arrives in the play, he immediately informs Faustus that he is completely under Lucifer’s control and can only do what Lucifer commands. Through this quote, Mephostophilis clarifies that while he has abilities with dark magic, he can only do what Lucifer approves. Despite Mephostophilis appearing when Faustus conjures him, this quote presents Mephostophilis as a servant of Lucifer and clearly delineates to whom Mephostophilis belongs.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/mephostophilis"},{"quote":"Why this is hell, nor am I out of it. Think’st thou that I who saw the face of God And tasted the eternal joys of heaven Am not tormented with ten thousand hells In being deprived of everlasting bliss? O Faustus, leave these frivolous demands Which strikes a terror to my fainting soul!","desc":"As Faustus pursues a bargain with Lucifer, he discusses Mephostophilis’ role as Lucifer’s agent. In these lines, Mephostophilis explains that all the devils are “unhappy spirits that fell” and that his service to Faustus makes up part of his hell. He passionately pleads with Faustus to reconsider his decision to go toward dark magic, describing his regret and torment in knowing he will never experience the joys of heaven again.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/mephostophilis"},{"quote":"What will not I do to obtain his soul!","desc":"In this short declaration referencing Faustus, Mephostophilis secretly reveals his devilish intentions with Faustus. He makes this statement aside to the audience, slyly identifying his sinister motives to the audience while maintaining a friendly, guide-like persona with Faustus. Mephostophilis works directly for Lucifer, and in this line, he only confirms that he must and will do whatever it takes to convince Faustus to give up his soul to Lucifer.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/mephostophilis"},{"quote":"Faustus. When I behold the heavens, then I repent And curse thee, wicked Mephostophilis, Because thou has deprived me of those joys. Mephostophilis. ’Twas thine own seeking Faustus, thank thyself. But thin’st thou heaven is such a glorious thing? I tell thee, Faustus, it is not half so fair As thou or any man that breathe on earth.","desc":"Faustus contemplates redemption again and quickly blames Mephostophilis for depriving him of heaven. Mephostophilis reveals his strong character as he quickly responds to Faustus by reminding him that he, Faustus, initiated the relationship with Lucifer. In the next few lines, Mephostophilis slyly continues to persuade Faustus to let go of the idea of redemption, leading Faustus to believe giving up his soul was all his idea.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/mephostophilis"},{"quote":"Let it be so, my Faustus, but first stay And view their triumphs as they pass this way. And then devise what best contents thy mind By cunning in thine art to cross the Pope Or dash the pride of this solemnity— To make his monks and abbots stand like apes And point like antics at his triple crown, To beat the beads about the friars’ pates, Or clap huge horns upon the cardinals’ heads, Or any villainy thou canst devise— And I’ll perform it, Faustus. Hark, they come! This day shall make thee be admired in Rome!","desc":"While Faustus and Mephostophilis plot against the Pope and cardinals, Mephostophilis demonstrates his true control and power over Faustus. While he makes Faustus believe that all the plans are Faustus’s ideas, Mephostophilis ultimately plants every idea in Faustus’s head, persuading him to move forward with promises of fame and admiration in Rome. Mephostophilis even says “my Faustus,” implying his ownership of Faustus.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/mephostophilis"},{"quote":"Faustus... Sweet Mephostophilis, so charm me here That I may walk invisible to all And do whate’er I please unseen of any. Mephostophilis. Faustus, thou shalt. Then kneel down presently. Whilst on thy head I lay my hand And charm thee with this magic wand. First wear this girdle, then appear Invisible to all are here[.]","desc":"In this interaction between Faustus and Mephostophilis, Faustus requests that Mephostophilis use his power to make him invisible. Once again, Mephostophilis exhibits his power and control over Faustus. Even though Faustus made the deal with Lucifer to gain the power of dark magic, Mephostophilis, not Faustus, actually possesses the power. Mephostophilis then symbolically and literally makes Faustus invisible. Such an act is designed to intoxicate Faustus and ensure he willingly gives up his body and soul.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/mephostophilis"},{"quote":"This is but a small matter. Go Mephostophilis, away! . . . From whence, by means of a swift spirit that I have, I had these grapes brought as you see.","desc":"When Faustus offers to do something for the Emperor’s wife, she requests a dish of grapes. While Faustus claims the credit for bringing her the fruit, readers understand that Mephostophilis’ power actually accomplishes the task. Mephostophilis allows Faustus to believe he has the power, feeding into Faustus’s ambition and thus gaining further control over Faustus. The sly way that Mephostophilis worms into Faustus’s good graces demonstrates Mephostophilis’ devilish soul.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/mephostophilis"},{"quote":"Thou traitor Faustus, I arrest thy soul For disobedience to my sovereign lord. Revolt, or I’ll in piecemeal tear thy flesh . . . This or what else my Faustus shall desire Shall be performed in twinkling of an eye.","desc":"These lines spoken by Mephostophilis amid a conversation with Faustus about his commitment to Lucifer reveal Mephostophilis’ two-faced character. In one moment, Mephostophilis threatens to tear Faustus’s flesh if he disobeys Lucifer. Then, later in the conversation, once Faustus retreats and recommits to Lucifer, Mephostophilis says he will perform whatever task Faustus requests with a “twinkling of an eye.” This twinkling references the ulterior motives of anything Mephostophilis does for Faustus.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/mephostophilis"},{"quote":"How should he but in desperate lunacy? Fond worldling, now his heart blood dries with grief, His conscience kills it, and his laboring brain Begets a world of idle fantasies To overreach the devil; but all in vain: His store of pleasures must be sauced with pain!","desc":"In a conversation with Lucifer and Belzebub, Mephostophilis demonstrates his dark character as he shows no pity or mercy for Faustus as the twenty-four-year bargain comes to an end and Faustus faces damnation. Actually, in these lines, Mephostophilis appears to enjoy Faustus’s suffering, commenting on Faustus’s trivial fantasies, laughing at his vain attempts to escape his fate, and even suggesting that Faustus should receive extra pain.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/mephostophilis"},{"quote":"I do confess it Faustus, and rejoice. ’Twas I, that when thou wert i’ the way to heaven Dammed up thy passage. When thou took’st the book To view the Scriptures, then I turned the leaves And led thine eye. What, weep’st thou! ’Tis too late, despair, farewell! Fools that will laugh on earth, most weep in hell.","desc":"While Mephostophilis and Faustus discuss Faustus’s fate and fall from heaven, Mephostophilis admits that he tempted Faustus and persuaded him to go toward the darkness and make a deal with Lucifer even if Faustus was the one who made the ultimate decision. Not only does Mephostophilis proudly declare his skillful deception, he also shows no sympathy for Faustus, telling him that it’s too late to despair.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/mephostophilis"},{"quote":"Good Angel. O Faustus, lay that damnèd book aside And gaze not on it lest it tempt thy soul And heap God’s heavy wrath upon thy head! Read, read the Scriptures—that is blasphemy! Bad Angel. Go forward Faustus, in that famous art Wherein all nature’s treasure is contained. Be thou on earth as Jove is in the sky, Lord and commander of these elements!","desc":"The Good Angel and Bad Angel represent characters in this play as they symbolize the divided will of Faustus’s conscience. In these lines at the beginning of the play, the Good Angel and Bad Angel go back and forth, each providing counterarguments and contradicting directives to Faustus. The Good Angel tries to convince Faustus to avoid the devil’s book and read only Scripture, while the Bad Angel provides reasons why moving toward evil will benefit Faustus.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/good-angel-and-bad-angel"},{"quote":"Bad Angel. Go forward, Faustus, in that famous art. Good Angel. Sweet Faustus, leave that execrable art. Faustus. Contrition, prayer, repentance, what of these? Good Angel. O, they are means to bring thee unto heaven. Bad Angel. Rather illusions, fruits of lunacy; That make men foolish that do use them most.","desc":"The Good Angel and Bad Angel’s back-and-forth dialogue continues as they represent Faustus’s thinking as he contemplates sin versus redemption. In these lines, the Good Angel connects with Medieval thought as he encourages Faustus to repent and go back to God. Meanwhile, the Bad Angel represents the Renaissance individual as he tells Faustus that prayer is just an illusion so he should move forward toward Lucifer.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/good-angel-and-bad-angel"},{"quote":"Good Angel. Faustus, repent: yet God will pity thee! Bad Angel. Thou art a spirit: God cannot pity thee! Faustus. Who buzzeth in mine ears I am a spirit? Be I a devil, yet God may pity me— Yea, God will pity me if I repent. Bad Angel. Ay, but Faustus never shall repent.","desc":"Here, the Good Angel and the Bad Angel go back and forth with Faustus once again. However, these lines end with the Bad Angel declaring that Faustus will not repent. Since the Good Angel and Bad Angel represent Faustus’s thinking, this line confirms that evil is winning the battle for Faustus’s soul. Soon after these lines are spoken, Faustus admits that he cannot repent, proving the Bad Angel’s prediction or perhaps merely following the Bad Angel’s suggestion.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/good-angel-and-bad-angel"},{"quote":"Good Angel. O Faustus, if thou hadst given ear to me Innumerable joys had followèd thee. But thou did’st love the world. Bad Angel. Gave ear to me, And now must taste hell’s pains perpetually. Good Angel. O, what will all thy riches, pleasures, pomps Avail thee now? Bad Angel. Nothing but vex thee more, To want in hell, that had on earth such store.","desc":"In the final act of the play, the Good Angel and Bad Angel represent and give voice to Faustus’s regret and second-guessing as he approaches his final damnation in Hell. While the Good Angel reminds Faustus of the joys he lost by giving up god, both the Good Angel and the Bad Angel question Faustus on how the riches, fame, and power will help him now. The angels basically present Faustus with his moral lesson.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/good-angel-and-bad-angel"},{"quote":"Good Angel... And now, poor soul, must thy good angel leave thee, The jaws of hell are open to receive thee. Bad Angel. Now Faustus, let thine eyes with horror stare Into that vast perpetual torture-house . . . Nay, thou must feel them, taste the smart of all: He that loves pleasure must for pleasure fall. And so I leave thee Faustus, till anon: Then wilt thou tumble in confusion.","desc":"As the play concludes, the Good Angel’s and Bad Angel’s back-and-forth ends as the Good Angel concedes the loss of Faustus’s soul. In these lines, the Bad Angel also tells Faustus that he must prepare for hell by looking at the tortured, fallen souls before him. In the end and despite the Good Angel’s best efforts, the Bad Angel wins Faustus’s soul, symbolizing how Faustus finally accepts his dark fate.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/good-angel-and-bad-angel"},{"quote":"Only this, gentles—We must now perform The form of Faustus’ fortunes, good or bad: And now to patient judgements we appeal And speak for Faustus in his infancy . . . So much he profits in divinity That shortly he was graced with doctor’s name, Excelling all, and sweetly can dispute In th’ heavenly matters of theology; Till swoll’n with cunning, of a self-conceit, His waxen wings did mount above his reach And melting, heavens conspired his overthrow!","desc":"The Chorus acts as a character in this play, giving the audience important details surrounding the events and main characters. In the Prologue, the Chorus introduces the purpose of Marlowe’s play: to tell the story of Faustus’s struggle between good and evil. In addition, the Chorus provides important background information about Faustus’s character, specifically his strong connection with divinity. Finally, the Chorus foreshadows Faustus’s fall from heaven by comparing him to the Greek figure, Icarus.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/chorus"},{"quote":"Learnèd Faustus, To find the secrets of astronomy . . . He views the clouds, the planets, and the stars, The tropics, zones, and quarters of the sky . . . He now is gone to prove cosmography, That measures coasts and kingdoms of the earth, And as I guess will first arrive at Rome To see the Pope and manner of his court And take some part of hold Peter’s feast, The which this day is highly solemnized.","desc":"Here, the Chorus identifies what Faustus has been doing since he accepted the bargain he made with Lucifer. In these lines, the Chorus explains that Faustus has focused on learning, connecting him to the Renaissance movement as he moves away from the Medieval focus on God. Next, the Chorus introduces Faustus’s plans to join the Pope in Rome, continuing the Chorus’s role as an important narrator.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/chorus"},{"quote":"When Faustus had with pleasure ta’en the view Of rarest things and royal courts of kings, He stayed his course and so returned home . . . Which Faustus answered with such learnèd skill As they admired and wondered at his wit. Now is his fame spread forth in every land. Amongst the rest the Emperor is one, Carolus the Fifth, at whose palace now Faustus is feasted ’mongst his noblemen.","desc":"Continuing the role of narrator, the Chorus explains that Faustus has been impressing friends and strangers and is currently visiting the Emperor in order to entertain him as well. Through these lines, the Chorus clarifies that Faustus has been getting the admiration that he always wanted and for which he traded his soul to the devil. For the time being, Faustus appears to be reaping the benefits of his wicked and tragic trade.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/chorus"},{"quote":"Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight And burnèd is Apollo’s laurel bough That sometime grew within this learnèd man. Faustus is gone: regard his hellish fall, Whose fiendful fortune may exhort the wise Only to wonder at unlawful things, Whose deepness doth entice such forward wits To practice more than heavenly power permits.","desc":"Just as the Chorus opens the play, the Chorus concludes Faustus’s story by remarking on his wayward path. The Chorus warns the audience to “regard his hellish fall,” reminding them what happens to those who “practice more than heavenly power permits.” In other words, the Chorus provides the moral lesson that comes from Faustus’s story: One should always choose redemption over sin.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/chorus"},{"quote":"I am a servant to great Lucifer And may not follow thee without his leave. No more than he commands must we perform.","desc":"Mephostophilis introduces Lucifer as he explains to Faustus that he is completely under the control of Lucifer. Through this statement, Mephostophilis immediately identifies the character of Lucifer as synonymous with the prince of the devils, also known as Satan. Mephostophilis explains that Lucifer is the actual master and the only one truly in control.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/lucifer"},{"quote":"Faustus... Tell me, what is that Lucifer thy lord? Mephostophilis. Arch-regent and commander of all spirits. Faustus. Was not that Lucifer an angel once? Mephostophilis. Yes Faustus, and most dearly loved of God. Faustus. How comes it then that he is prince of devils? Mephostophilis. O, by aspiring pride and insolence, For which God threw him from the face of heaven.","desc":"This conversation between Faustus and Mephostophilis describes Lucifer’s background and how he came to be the prince of the devils. Mephostophilis explains that Lucifer was once an angel and dearly loved by God, but his arrogance and disrespect led to his dismissal from heaven. Lucifer’s story gives his character depth and complexity but also explains how he became the master of hell.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/lucifer"},{"quote":"Thus from infernal Dis do we ascend To view the subjects of our monarchy, Those souls which sin seals the black sons of hell. ’Mong which as chief, Faustus, we come to thee, Bringing with us lasting damnation To wait upon thy soul. The time is come Which make it forfeit.","desc":"Lucifer meets with Belzebub and Mephostophilis to witness Faustus’s last night before damnation. Here, Lucifer describes coming to watch the souls whose sins have sent them to hell. His ultimate darkness becomes clear as Lucifer seems to hungrily wait for Faustus’s arrival in hell. Clearly Lucifer delights in others’ suffering.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/lucifer"},{"quote":"No Faustus, curse thyself, curse Lucifer That hath deprived thee of the joys of heaven . . . It strikes, it strikes! Now body, turn to air, Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell!

Not only does Lucifer control the other devils, such as Mephostophilis who persuaded Faustus to turn to evil, but he strikes fear in those whose souls he claims. In these lines, Faustus curses Lucifer but also describes how Lucifer shows no pity for his victims.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doctorfaustus/quotes/character/lucifer"}]
