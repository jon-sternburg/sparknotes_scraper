[{"quote":"Algernon: “Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of it.”","desc":"Algernon speaks these lines in Act I, replying to Jack’s announcement that he plans to kill off his imaginary brother and his suggestion that Algernon do the same with Bunbury. Jack has just denied being what Algernon called “a Bunburyist,” that is, someone who leads a double life or otherwise engages in an elaborate deception that allows him to misbehave and seem virtuous at the same time. Jack thinks that once he is married to Gwendolen he will no longer need the ruse of the irresponsible brother because he will be happy, and he won’t want to disappear. Algernon counters with the suggestion that it is the married man who needs Bunbury most of all.On one level, this exchange merely continues the long-running marriage gag, which treats the whole Victorian notion of “married bliss” with a kind of gallows humor. However, it also initiates the play’s darker subtext. What Algernon suggests is that all husbands in Victorian society lead double lives. In Wilde’s view, Jack’s refusal to acknowledge that he is “a Bunburyist” is what differentiates him from Algernon from a purely moral perspective. Jack’s refusal to admit what he is makes him a hypocrite. Later, when Jack is forced to confess that Ernest was a fiction, and that in reality he has no brother, he makes a speech about the pain involved in being forced to speak the truth. When, at the end, he discovers that he really has been both Ernest and John all along, he tells Gwendolen that “it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.” Gwendolen forgives him, she says, because she feels he is “sure to change.” She is probably right. Jack hasn’t been telling the truth all along, and he wasn’t telling the truth when he implied that his invented brother was a ruse for getting away to see her. In fact, Jack’s desire to get away from Hertfordshire has been motivated by a desire to do things that conflict with “a very high moral tone.” Algernon and Gwendolen are likely right: before too long, Jack will feel the call of Bunbury again.","page":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/"},{"quote":"Lady Bracknell: “I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.”","desc":"Lady Bracknell says these lines in the scene in Act I in which she interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a suitor for Gwendolen. She has just told him she believes that a man who wants to marry should know either everything or nothing, and Jack, sensing a trap, has said he knows nothing. Lady Bracknell greets the news with complacency and says only, “I am pleased to hear it.” Wilde is on one level sending up the boorish ignorance and vacuity of the British leisured classes, qualities he had certainly encountered in the person of Lord Alfred Douglas’s voluble and undereducated father, whose provocative, misspelled note would ultimately lead to Wilde’s downfall. On another level, Wilde is making a serious social and political point. A good deal of truth exists in what Lady Bracknell says. Education, if it were effective in England, probably would threaten the established order. Lady Bracknell is implying that if the poor and the downtrodden in England knew anything about anything they would overthrow the ruling class.The speech exemplifies one of the ways in which Wilde’s comedy works. The characters in The Importance of Being Earnest are not realistic or true to life. They don’t display consistency of temperament or viewpoint, even within a given scene or speech. They’re literary constructs, artificial creations whose purpose is to give voice to a particular utterance at a particular moment. Wilde uses Lady Bracknell to embody the mind-boggling stupidity of the British aristocracy, while at the same time, he allows her to voice some of the most trenchant observations in the play.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/page/2"},{"quote":"Jack: “You don’t think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother in about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?” Algernon: “All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That’s his.” Jack: “Is that clever?” Algernon: “It is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in civilized life should be.”","desc":"This exchange between Algernon and Jack in Act I occurs after Lady Bracknell has swept indignantly out of the house in response to Jack’s inability to produce any ancestry. In some ways it foreshadows the future, since Gwendolen really does resemble her mother in a number of ways. Like Lady Bracknell, she is somewhat ruthless and overbearing, and she demonstrates similar habits of speech and frames of mind, including a propensity to monomania (witness her obsession with the name “Ernest”) and a tendency to make absurd categorical pronouncements. If Gwendolen’s voice were turned up a few decibels, it might be indistinguishable from that of Lady Bracknell.Algernon’s reply to Jack’s question is a perfect example of the Wildean epigram: a statement that briefly and elegantly turns some piece of received or conventional wisdom on its head. Another example is Algernon’s assertion that “The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!” Typically, the Wildean epigram consists of two elements: an outrageous statement followed by an explanation that is at once even more outrageous and at the same time true. Or, as in the quotation above, it can consist of an antithesis: “On the one hand A; on the other hand B.” When Algernon tells Jack his witticism is “perfectly phrased” and “quite as true as any observation in civilized life should be,” he is voicing the moral perspective of the Wildean dandy, who believes that nothing is more important than the beauty of form and that elegance rather than accuracy or truth should dictate what people say.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/page/3"},{"quote":"Algernon: “Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily. You mustn’t think that I am wicked.” Cecily: “If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would be hypocrisy.”","desc":"This exchange between Algernon and Cecily occurs in Act II when Algernon, who is presenting himself as Jack’s brother Ernest, is shown into the garden. He greets Cecily, calling her his “little cousin,” and she greets him as “my wicked cousin Ernest.” The moral status of Jack’s fictional brother has undergone a change between Acts I and II. At Algernon’s flat in Half Moon Street, “Ernest” was merely “profligate” (Algernon’s word). To use Jack’s terminology, he got into “scrapes,” which is to say “jams” or mischief. Precisely what Jack considers a “scrape” isn’t made clear in Act I. They are, however, something Algernon is fond of. When Jack warns him that Bunbury may get him into “a serious scrape some day,” Algernon replies, “I love scrapes. They are the only things that are never serious.”Once the action moves to the garden of the Manor House, where Miss Prism’s moral viewpoint seems to hold sway, Jack’s brother graduates to “unfortunate,” “bad,” and downright “wicked.” Cecily yearns to meet a “really wicked” person, she says. The moment before Algernon enters, she soliloquizes that she’s terrified “he will look just like everyone else.”This open interest in the idea of immorality is what takes Cecily out of the realm of Victorian hypocrisy and makes her a suitable love interest for Algernon. Her notion that if Jack’s brother is not really wicked he has been “deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner” turns the plot of the play on its head. She goes on to define hypocrisy as “pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time.” It isn’t, of course. It is the opposite of hypocrisy. In fact, it is the creed of the Wildean dandy-hero.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/page/4"},{"quote":"Lady Bracknell: “My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality.” Jack: “On the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I’ve now realized for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”","desc":"These lines form the last exchange in the play. At this point in the play, the notion of earnestness has taken several forms. Earnestness is a concept that can be best grasped by looking at its opposites. Here it is presented as the opposite of “triviality,” while elsewhere it means the opposite of seriousness. When Jack scoffs at the idea of a “serious Bunburyist,” Algernon retorts, “Well, one must be serious about something ... What on earth you are serious about I haven’t got the remotest idea. About everything, I should fancy. You have such an absolutely trivial nature.” In terms of the play’s primary plot, earnestness is the quality of honesty or candor. But exactly what the play really says about this attribute is hard to determine. Algernon professes not to believe that truth belongs in civilized conversation. Jack doesn’t think truth “quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.” Cecily thinks that “whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one should always be quite candid.” Lady Bracknell believes that a woman should always lie about her age. Gwendolen feels that “In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.” Of course, which of these characters is speaking the truth about the truth is impossible to determine.One of the moral paradoxes that The Importance of Being Earnest seems intended to express is the idea that the perfectly moral man is the man who professes to be immoral, who speaks truly by virtue of the fact that he admits to being essentially a liar. Wilde set great store in lying, which, he argued in a quasi-Platonic dialogue called “The Decay of Lying,” is a veritable art form. Art itself may really be what’s at stake here. From Wilde’s standpoint, the poseur is to be congratulated and commended if his affectations bespeak elegance and style and achieve beauty. If they do, he is close to an artist. If they don’t, he is only a hypocrite.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/page/5"},{"quote":"JACK. My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all. In fact it’s perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew.","desc":"Jack, masquerading as Ernest, speaks to Algernon Moncrieff, who has asked him to explain the engraved dedication from Cecily in his cigarette case. Algernon has debunked Jack’s various evasions including not knowing anyone named Cecily and having an aunt named Cecily. Here, Jack finally tells Algernon the truth: Cecily is his ward. Jack delivers his explanation, full of improbable twists and turns, as an ordinary scenario. Much of the play’s comedy comes from stretching coincidences to the point of farce. The play also satirizes the Victorian audience’s expectations of melodramatic plot lines and their usual endings.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/theme/melodrama"},{"quote":"MISS PRISM.

That is what Fiction means.","desc":"Cecily and her governess, Miss Prism, discuss the romance novels of the time, wildly popular with women readers. The dialogue reveals that both women have melodramatic imaginations. Miss Prism’s confession lays out the first clue to her role in the play’s absurdly melodramatic plot. Miss Prism defines fiction as happy endings for good characters and justice for the bad. By Miss Prism’s standards, the ending of the play will not be fiction, since good and bad people are not rewarded according to their just deserts.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/theme/melodrama"},{"quote":"ALGERNON.

The next day I bought this little ring in your name, and this is the little bangle with the true lover’s knot I promised you always to wear.","desc":"Cecily explains to Algernon the details of her engagement to Ernest, which has taken place entirely in her imagination. She thinks Algernon is Ernest, the fictional wayward brother of Jack, Cecily’s guardian. Cecily, unaware that Jack invented Ernest to hide his own reprobate behavior, has fallen in love with Ernest. Algernon, who has learned from Jack of Cecily’s interest in Ernest, masquerades as Ernest so that Cecily will fall in love with him. The plot builds so melodramatically as to ridicule the genre.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/theme/melodrama"},{"quote":"MISS PRISM. On the morning of the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator. I had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few unoccupied hours. In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never can forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and placed the baby in the hand-bag.","desc":"Miss Prism, Cecily’s governess, explains how she came to lose an infant under her care. Wilde uses the melodramatic plot device of mistaken identity but with an ironic twist. Miss Prism substitutes her manuscript for a human baby, which shows she thinks of herself as having given birth to a work of literature. The audience already knows that Jack had been found in a hand-bag, so Miss Prism’s statement serves as a strong clue that Jack’s true parentage will soon be revealed.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/theme/melodrama"},{"quote":"ALGERNON.

Is marriage so demoralising as that?","desc":"Algernon discusses household finances with his manservant, Lane. The scene establishes a relationship familiar to stage comedies and light operas, that of the indolent, self-indulgent aristocrat and his worldly, wily servant. The audience would expect the servant to try to keep his master from marrying, so as not to cut off his own comforts. The informality between the supposed master and his servant suggests that they share at least some of their vices.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/theme/marriage"},{"quote":"JACK.

Why, one may be accepted.","desc":"Jack confides in Algernon about his intentions toward Gwendolen, Algernon’s cousin. Algernon’s response reveals his aristocratic attitude that marriage functions primarily as a financial arrangement. Algernon also maintains a confirmed bachelor’s antagonism toward marriage in general. Jack’s feelings seem sincere, until we recall he has assumed the identity of Ernest, his fictional dissolute younger brother. Jack courts Gwendolen under false pretenses, while accusing Algernon of being unromantic.

The reluctant rector and the aging, marriage-mad spinster do battle through witty repartee. He pleads his clerical vow of celibacy, which leads Miss Prism to counter with a rebuke of his bachelor status as a moral temptation. Her suggestion that Doctor Chasuble is irresistible to women shows a skilled and practiced hand at flirting.

However, the plot plays with the conventional happy ending. Miss Prism gets the reward of marriage and escapes any punishment for having mislaid a baby. Readers may also infer that Miss Prism’s marriage serves as her punishment. The other two marriages reward the grooms more than the brides. Jack, now revealed to be secretly aristocratic by birth, marries into the landed gentry. Algernon marries a woman with a fortune large enough to support his indolent lifestyle. The audience doubts any of them will live happily ever after.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/theme/marriage"},{"quote":"ALGERNON.

I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is perfectly invaluable.","desc":"Algernon explains to Jack why they both qualify as Bunburyists—people who have assumed false identities. Although Jack resents this accusation, Algernon does not intend his words as an insult. In fact, Algernon feels amused to discover the subterfuge of his outwardly earnest friend. The false identities assumed by Algernon and Jack drive the plot of the play.

Their hypocritical piety appears even more ridiculous by the audience’s awareness that Ernest does not actually exist.

I don’t know any one of the name of Cecily.","desc":"After Jack announces his intention to marry Gwendolen, Algernon refuses to consent to the marriage. Here, Algernon brings up the name of Cecily, and Jack vehemently denies knowing any such person, raising suspicion. Jack will eventually come up with an innocent explanation for Cecily, but the audience won’t necessarily believe him.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/john-worthing-jp"},{"quote":"JACK. It isn’t Ernest; it’s Jack. ALGERNON. You have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every one as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your name was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn’t Ernest. It’s on your cards.","desc":"Jack confides his real name to Algernon, only to have Algernon refuse to believe him. Algernon’s description reveals the difference between how other people see Jack and how he sees himself. The repetition of the name Ernest reminds the audience that Jack has entered society, even tried to enter Algernon’s family, under false pretenses.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/john-worthing-jp"},{"quote":"JACK. When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects. It’s one’s duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either one’s health or one’s happiness, in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.","desc":"Here, Jack explains to Algernon why he calls himself by two different names. Jack’s reasoning reveals the depths of his deception and hypocrisy: He invented a younger brother as a cover for his own departures from virtue, using filial loyalty to justify his falsehood. The play leaves to the audience’s imagination exactly what Jack gets into as Ernest, but the plot gives hints such as Ernest picking up expensive restaurant tabs for Algernon.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/john-worthing-jp"},{"quote":"JACK. Not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed I think I’ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a little too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going to get rid of Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr... with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.","desc":"Jack disputes Algernon’s claim that he lives as a hypocrite with a false identity, by confiding his plans to kill off his fictional younger brother. Without realizing what he’s done, Jack gives Algernon vital information: Cecily, Jack’s beautiful young ward, feels interested in Ernest. Jack’s speech also makes Algernon realize he has very little time to act on the information.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/john-worthing-jp"},{"quote":"JACK. The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and kindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time. Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort.","desc":"Jack explains to Lady Bracknell the circumstances surrounding his birth. Although the details seem ridiculously melodramatic, he delivers the speech seriously, even adding useless information about the city of Worthing. He pedantically explains his last name while using a false first name. Although Jack’s benefactor made Jack wealthy, Jack’s dubious origins make him completely unsuitable for marriage to the aristocratic Gwendolen.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/john-worthing-jp"},{"quote":"ALGERNON. By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being Ernest in town, and Jack in the country? JACK [In a very patronising manner]. My dear fellow, the truth isn’t quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl. What extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!","desc":"Algernon confronts Jack about deceiving Gwendolen, Algernon’s cousin. Jack’s dismissive attitude reveals him as a person with no sense of honor, completely unaware of how aristocrats like Algernon and Gwendolen despise his contemptible pretenses. Having confessed his double identity to Algernon, Jack now feels free to continue his deception. He is truly a cad.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/john-worthing-jp"},{"quote":"JACK [Slowly and hesitatingly]. Gwendolen—Cecily—it is very painful for me to be forced to speak the truth. It is the first time in my life that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind. However, I will tell you quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest. I have no brother at all. I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the smallest intention of ever having one in the future.","desc":"Jack admits at last that Ernest never existed. His admission proves that Algernon has also been lying, since he has been pretending to be a fictional person. The double revelation leaves Cecily and Gwendolen in the position of being engaged to the same fictional person. Jack’s admission also foreshadows the final resolution of the plot.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/john-worthing-jp"},{"quote":"JACK. It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his moral character. I suspect him of being untruthful. [Algernon and Cecily look at him in indignant amazement.]","desc":"Jack refuses to allow Algernon to marry his ward, Cecily, on the grounds of Algernon’s poor moral character. Algernon and Cecily react with indignation because Jack already admitted to being fraudulent himself. Jack punishes Algernon for exposing the fake Ernest, still not acknowledging his own fault in inventing Ernest in the first place.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/john-worthing-jp"},{"quote":"JACK. Algy’s elder brother! Then I have a brother after all. I knew I had a brother! I always said I had a brother! Cecily,—how could you have ever doubted that I had a brother? [Seizes hold of Algernon.] Dr. Chasuble, my unfortunate brother. Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother. Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother. Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to treat me with more respect in the future. You have never behaved to me like a brother in all your life.","desc":"Jack responds exuberantly to Lady Bracknell’s revelation that he and Algernon are long-lost brothers. Due to an absurdly improbable series of plot twists, Jack regains his place among the aristocracy. He celebrates by rubbing Algernon’s nose in this new reality, introducing “Algy” to all the others as his unfortunate brother. The audience understands that Algernon, Gwendolen, and Lady Bracknell do not necessarily feel fortunate in finding this long-lost relation.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/john-worthing-jp"},{"quote":"LADY BRACKNELL. Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well. ALGERNON. I’m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta. LADY BRACKNELL. That’s not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go together. [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]","desc":"Lady Augusta Bracknell, Algernon’s aunt, represents another rich source of satire: the high-society dowager who often acts as the wealthy relative of the penniless playboy protagonist. Her opening rebuke establishes her long-suffering indulgence of her nephew’s antics and comes equipped with moral rectitude. Her chilly civility to Jack dismisses him. Lady Bracknell serves as the wiser, cooler head, balancing the wacky antics of the other characters.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/lady-augusta-bracknell"},{"quote":"LADY BRACKNELL. Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others. Health is the primary duty of life.","desc":"Lady Bracknell objects to Algernon’s attentions to his chronically ill friend. Algernon uses Mr. Bunbury, his fictional invalid friend, to weasel out of social commitments, a pattern that she has noted. Her response parodies smug self-centeredness in her disdain for other people’s petty problems. Her simple solution that Mr. Bunbury should choose life or death may also show she feels somewhat skeptical of her nephew’s story.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/lady-augusta-bracknell"},{"quote":"LADY BRACKNELL. Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one. When you do become engaged to some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will inform you of the fact. An engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be. It is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . .","desc":"Lady Bracknell responds to her daughter Gwendolen’s announcement that she has become engaged to Ernest Worthing. At this point in the plot, the audience sees Gwendolen making a rash decision, as she doesn’t know the real identity of the man she wants to marry. Lady Bracknell acts correctly in raising objections, however tyrannically she expresses herself.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/lady-augusta-bracknell"},{"quote":"LADY BRACKNELL. To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other’s character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.","desc":"Lady Bracknell delivers her opinion on engagements to Gwendolen, Cecily, Algernon, and Jack. She clearly favors the engagement of her indolent, penniless nephew Algernon to Cecily. Lady Bracknell just discovered Cecily stands to inherit considerable wealth, a fact that surely weighs heavily in her approval. Lady Bracknell’s advice to know little about your spouse plays as dramatic irony in the wake of Algernon’s and Jack’s revelations of their identities to their future wives.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/lady-augusta-bracknell"},{"quote":"LADY BRACKNELL. A few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police, the perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater. It contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality. [Miss Prism starts in involuntary indignation.] But the baby was not there! [Every one looks at Miss Prism.] Prism! Where is that baby?","desc":"Lady Bracknell demands answers from Miss Prism, moving the plot forward. The image of an empty baby carriage at midnight on a deserted street builds unexpected suspense and poignancy. The audience picks up the clue of the three-volume novel and anticipates a plot twist resolving the mystery of Jack’s parentage.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/lady-augusta-bracknell"},{"quote":"LADY BRACKNELL. [Meditatively]. I cannot at the present moment recall what the General’s Christian name was. But I have no doubt he had one. He was eccentric, I admit. But only in later years. And that was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of that kind.","desc":"Lady Bracknell milks her final moments onstage by adding comic suspense around the issue of Jack’s real name. She rambles around in her memories of Jack’s father, recalling some details about him but making obvious she never bothered to learn his name. To call Jack’s father eccentric puts things mildly, since the General seems to have forgotten to tell Algernon about the existence and loss of his older brother.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/lady-augusta-bracknell"},{"quote":"JACK. You’re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax. GWENDOLEN. Oh! I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for developments, and I intend to develop in many directions. [Gwendolen and Jack sit down together in the corner.]","desc":"Gwendolen Fairfax makes her entrance by following her mother, Lady Bracknell, into her cousin Algernon’s apartment. She immediately starts flirting with Ernest Worthing, Algernon’s friend, who wants to marry her. Gwendolen serves notice of her ambitious approach to life as a social climber. Her self-interest will lead her to misread characters throughout the course of the play.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/gwendolen-fairfax"},{"quote":"GWENDOLEN. Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at all, indeed. It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John! And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John. She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment’s solitude. The only really safe name is Ernest.","desc":"Gwendolen assures Ernest Worthing that she loves his safe, solid name. Unaware that she addresses John Worthington also known as Jack, she disparages the names based on her stereotypes. Her characterizations of Johns and Jacks as homebodies creates a humorous contrast with the fictional Ernest who sees himself as a reprobate man about town. Her attitude creates a comic quandary for Jack while satirizing romantic ideals.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/gwendolen-fairfax"},{"quote":"JACK. My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you. GWENDOLEN. Yes, but men often propose for practice. I know my brother Gerald does. All my girl-friends tell me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest! They are quite, quite, blue. I hope you will always look at me just like that, especially when there are other people present.","desc":"Gwendolen shows herself to be a practiced flirt as she responds to Jack’s declaration of love. She admits to encouraging the public spectacle of Jack’s adoration, using a witticism to turn her self-centeredness into a source of charm. Her type of artifice appears similar to that of her cousin Algernon. Jack’s subterfuge, however, seems less innocent: He pretends to be Ernest, a fictional person, and even proposes marriage under this persona.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/gwendolen-fairfax"},{"quote":"GWENDOLEN. Oh! It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a ward. How secretive of him! He grows more interesting hourly. I am not sure, however, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight. [Rising and going to her.] I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked you ever since I met you! But I am bound to state that now that I know that you are Mr. Worthing’s ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you were—well, just a little older than you seem to be—and not quite so very alluring in appearance.","desc":"Gwendolen responds to Cecily’s statement that she lives as Mr. Worthing’s ward. Like Algernon—and the audience—Gwendolen feels suspicious about Jack’s intentions in regard to his ward. She confronts Cecily as a competitor, by expressing her wish that Cecily should be older and less attractive.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/gwendolen-fairfax"},{"quote":"CECILY [Very politely, rising]. I am afraid you must be under some misconception. Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago. [Shows diary.] GWENDOLEN [Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully]. It is certainly very curious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30. If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so. [Produces diary of her own.] I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train. I am so sorry, dear Cecily, if it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior claim.","desc":"Gwendolen and Cecily quarrel over which one of them has the legitimate engagement to Ernest Worthing, using their diaries like legal documentation to back up their claims. The dialogue portrays the rivalry between two practiced competitors in the game of courtship. Gwendolen’s speech reveals that she, like Cecily, constructs her own reality in her diary and makes her life appear sensational.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/gwendolen-fairfax"},{"quote":"GWENDOLEN... Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for pretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible? JACK. Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax? GWENDOLEN. I have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intend to crush them. This is not the moment for German skepticism.","desc":"Gwendolen puts the words she wants to hear into Jack’s mouth because she eagerly wants to move on to the marriage. Her response to Jack’s rhetorical question reveals that she doesn’t really believe Jack. But she feels fine pretending to believe him, especially now that she has seen his country estate and her cousin Algernon has secured the fortune of Jack’s ward. Gwendolen operates as a realist about romance.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/gwendolen-fairfax"},{"quote":"ALGERNON. But I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too much interested in your poor brother Ernest? Won’t she feel his loss a good deal? JACK. Oh, that is all right. Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad to say. She has got a capital appetite, goes on long walks, and pays no attention at all to her lessons. ALGERNON. I would rather like to see Cecily. JACK. I will take very good care you never do. She is excessively pretty, and she is only just eighteen[.]","desc":"Cecily Cardew enters the play long before she makes her appearance on stage. Her guardian Jack describes her while confiding his secrets to Algernon Moncrieff. Jack decides that his alter ego as a younger brother Ernest has to end. Jack seems to be dangling Cecily like bait, and the audience suspects how Algernon will respond. As Jack will no longer have use for Ernest, Algernon sees an opportunity to assume Ernest’s identity and embody Cecily’s fantasies.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/cecily-cardew"},{"quote":"CECILY [Coming over very slowly]. But I don’t like German. It isn’t at all a becoming language. I know perfectly well that I look plain after my German lesson.","desc":"Cecily makes her first appearance onstage in a rose garden, the appropriate romantic setting of sentimental melodramas. Cecily should be studying with Miss Prism, her tutor. She complains vociferously about her German lessons. References to the German language and sensibility as representing respectability recur throughout the play. Cecily’s preoccupation with her appearance over substance satirize this connection while giving insight into her youth and self-absorption.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/cecily-cardew"},{"quote":"ALGERNON. My letters! But my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you any letters. CECILY. You need hardly remind me of that, Ernest. I remember only too well that I was forced to write your letters for you. I wrote always three times a week, and sometimes oftener.","desc":"Cecily addresses Algernon, who masquerades as Ernest Worthing, Jack Worthing’s fictional younger brother. Algernon knows Cecily feels fascinated by Ernest. Cecily confesses that she’s secretly in love with Ernest—in fact, she’s constructed an entire fictional world around this romance. Her self-deception makes the opportunity easier for Algernon to exploit her fantasy but harder to wiggle out of the lie.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/cecily-cardew"},{"quote":"CECILY. You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish dream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest. [Algernon rises, Cecily also.] There is something in that name that seems to inspire absolute confidence. I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called Ernest.","desc":"Cecily continues to confide her romantic dreams to Algernon, revealing that she, like Gwendolen, feels attracted to the name Ernest. Her speech makes the audience wonder if Cecily and Gwendolen have been reading the same sentimental novel. As with Gwendolen, Cecily’s fixation on the name comically complicates the plot, since no such person as Ernest Worthing actually exists.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/cecily-cardew"},{"quote":"CECILY. Algy, would you wait for me till I was thirty-five? ALGERNON. Of course I could, Cecily. You know I could. CECILY. Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn’t wait all that time. I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody. It always makes me rather cross. I am not punctual, myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question. ALGERNON. Then what is to be done, Cecily? CECILY: I don’t know, Mr. Moncrieff.","desc":"Cecily consults Algernon about the new requirement set down by her guardian, Jack: She can’t be married without Jack’s permission until she reaches the age of thirty-five. Algernon’s willingness to wait years confirms Cecily’s suspicion of his ambivalence about marriage. Soon after Cecily admits she doesn’t know what will happen next, Lady Bracknell’s final revelations take over the play and sort out the plot, including the future of Algernon and Cecily.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/earnest/quotes/character/cecily-cardew"}]
